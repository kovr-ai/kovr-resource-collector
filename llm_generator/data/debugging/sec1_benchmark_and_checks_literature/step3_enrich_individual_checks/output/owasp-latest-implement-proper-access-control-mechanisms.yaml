    reason: Proper access control mechanisms help prevent the misuse of valid accounts
      by unauthorized entities or for unauthorized purposes.

  category: access_control
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control specifies the need for access control policies and procedures
      to ensure that only authorized users or entities can access and perform operations
      on sensitive data or resources.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-3
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement access control policies
      and procedures to restrict access to information and information processing
      facilities.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: Proper access control mechanisms are essential for ensuring that only
    authorized users or entities can access and perform operations on sensitive data,
    resources, or functionalities within an application or system. Implementing robust
    access control measures helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    potential misuse or abuse of privileged operations. This check validates that
    the application or system has implemented appropriate access control mechanisms,
    such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC),
    or other industry-standard access control models. Failure to implement proper
    access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential
    security breaches.
