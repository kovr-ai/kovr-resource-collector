    reason: Centralized log management can help detect and respond to impair defenses
      techniques, such as disabling or tampering with security tools, by providing
      visibility into system events and enabling timely detection of anomalies.

    reason: Centralized log management can help detect and respond to service stop
      techniques, such as stopping or disabling security services, by providing visibility
      into system events and enabling timely detection of anomalies.

  category: audit
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish an audit record repository
      and centralized management of audit logs, which aligns with the implementation
      of centralized log management.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-6
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish event logging procedures,
      including the centralized logging and monitoring of user activities, exceptions,
      and security events, which aligns with the implementation of centralized log
      management.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.4.1
  literature: Centralized log management is a critical security practice that involves
    collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from various sources (e.g., servers,
    applications, network devices) in a centralized location. This enables organizations
    to monitor and detect security incidents, troubleshoot issues, and comply with
    regulatory requirements. Without centralized log management, it becomes challenging
    to gain visibility into system activities, identify potential threats, and respond
    to incidents effectively. Implementing centralized log management enhances an
    organization's security posture by providing a comprehensive view of system events,
    enabling timely detection of anomalies, and facilitating incident response and
    forensic investigations.
