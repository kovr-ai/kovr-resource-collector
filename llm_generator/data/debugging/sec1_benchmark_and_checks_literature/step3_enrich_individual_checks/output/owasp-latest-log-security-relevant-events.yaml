check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check can help detect
      and investigate activities related to 'Credential Dumping', as logging security-relevant
      events can capture unauthorized access attempts and credential theft.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1081
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Logging security-relevant events can help detect and investigate activities
      related to 'Valid Accounts', as it can capture unauthorized access attempts
      and misuse of legitimate accounts.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check can help detect
      and investigate 'Brute Force' attacks, as logging security-relevant events can
      capture failed authentication attempts and other suspicious activities.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: audit
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to ensure that the information system
      generates audit records for security-relevant events, which aligns with the
      purpose of the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-2
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control mandates the content of audit records, including security-relevant
      events, which is directly related to the purpose of the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events'
      check.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-3
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish event logging procedures,
      including logging security-relevant events, which aligns with the purpose of
      the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.4.1
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. Logging security-relevant events helps detect and investigate
    potential security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and other malicious
    activities. It provides a record of system activities, user actions, and security-related
    incidents, enabling organizations to monitor and analyze system behavior, identify
    potential threats, and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.
