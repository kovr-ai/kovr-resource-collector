check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Implementing secure deployment processes can help mitigate the risk of
      successful supply chain compromise attacks, which involve the introduction of
      malicious code or components during the development or deployment process.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1195
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Secure deployment processes can help prevent unauthorized software from
      being deployed, which is a technique used in software deployment attacks.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1608
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and maintain baseline
      configurations and inventories of information systems, which is a key aspect
      of secure deployment processes.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to employ software development life
      cycle processes that incorporate information security considerations, which
      aligns with implementing secure deployment processes.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SA-10
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to ensure the secure development of
      software and systems, which includes secure deployment processes.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.14.2.2
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' check validates
    that an organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
    and infrastructure components. This includes ensuring that proper security controls
    are in place throughout the deployment lifecycle, such as code reviews, vulnerability
    scanning, secure configuration management, and access controls. Implementing secure
    deployment processes is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability of systems and data, as well as reducing the risk of successful
    cyber attacks.
