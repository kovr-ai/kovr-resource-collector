  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Monitoring for security advisories can help organizations detect and mitigate
      exploits targeting known vulnerabilities, which aligns with the objective of
      this ATT&CK technique.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.6
    reason: Security advisories often provide information about vulnerabilities that
      can be exploited through software updates or patches, which aligns with the
      objective of this ATT&CK technique.

  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to identify, report, and correct information
      system flaws in a timely manner, which aligns with the objective of monitoring
      for security advisories.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SI-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to manage vulnerabilities associated
      with information systems, which includes monitoring for security advisories
      to identify and address vulnerabilities.

  literature: Security advisories are notifications issued by software vendors, security
    researchers, or other organizations to inform users about vulnerabilities, security
    flaws, or other security-related issues in their products or services. Monitoring
    for security advisories is crucial because it allows organizations to stay informed
    about potential threats and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks. Failing
    to monitor for security advisories can leave systems and applications vulnerable
    to known attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromises, or
    other security incidents.
