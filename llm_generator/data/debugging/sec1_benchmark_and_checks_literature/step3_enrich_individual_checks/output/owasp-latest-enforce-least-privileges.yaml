check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Enforcing least privilege reduces the risk of adversaries abusing valid
      accounts with excessive permissions for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.75
    reason: Limiting privileges can help prevent adversaries from exploiting data
      stored in cloud storage objects that they should not have access to.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1486
  category: access_control
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.95
    reason: This control requires organizations to employ the principle of least privilege,
      allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of
      users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-6
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control mandates that organizations shall restrict access rights
      to information and information processing facilities based on the principle
      of least privilege.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.1.1
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check validates that applications
    and systems follow the principle of least privilege, which is a fundamental security
    concept that restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only
    those permissions that are essential for performing their intended functions.
    Granting excessive privileges increases the potential attack surface and risk
    of unauthorized access or misuse. This check helps mitigate threats like privilege
    escalation, unauthorized data access, and malicious code execution by ensuring
    that entities operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
