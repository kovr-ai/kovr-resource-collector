check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: The 'Valid Accounts' technique involves an adversary using a legitimate
      account's credentials to gain initial access or elevate privileges on a system.
      The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check helps mitigate
      this technique by ensuring that access controls are properly implemented on
      the server-side, preventing unauthorized access to protected resources.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: The 'Data from Cloud Storage Object' technique involves an adversary accessing
      data from a cloud storage object that has been misconfigured or has excessive
      permissions. The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side'
      check helps mitigate this technique by ensuring that access controls are properly
      implemented on the server-side, preventing unauthorized access to cloud storage
      objects.

  category: access_control
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the enforcement of approved authorizations for logical
      access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access
      control policies. The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side'
      check directly validates the implementation of access controls on the server-side,
      ensuring that only authorized users or entities can access protected resources.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-3
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the implementation of a policy for user access control,
      which should be based on business and security requirements for access. The
      'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check helps ensure
      that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side, aligning with
      this control's requirement.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. Access controls are essential security mechanisms that ensure
    only authorized users or entities can access and perform specific actions on protected
    resources or data. Failing to implement proper access controls on the server-side
    can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security vulnerabilities.
    This check helps identify and mitigate risks associated with improper access control
    implementation, such as broken authentication, broken access control, and insecure
    direct object references.
