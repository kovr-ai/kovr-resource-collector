check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Using secure communication protocols like HTTPS can help mitigate the
      risk of network traffic being intercepted and exposed, which is a technique
      used in the 'Network Sniffing' attack.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1040
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Secure communication protocols like HTTPS can help prevent man-in-the-middle
      attacks, which are used in the 'Man-in-the-Middle' technique to intercept and
      manipulate network traffic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1557
  category: encryption
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the implementation of mechanisms to protect the
      confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information, which aligns with
      the use of secure communication protocols like HTTPS.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-8
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the implementation of network controls to protect
      information in networks and the supporting information processing facilities,
      which includes the use of secure communication protocols.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.13.1.1
  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    designed to ensure that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect data in transit from unauthorized access,
    interception, and tampering. HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client
    and server, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This is crucial
    for protecting sensitive information like credentials, personal data, and financial
    transactions. Failing to use secure communication protocols can expose data to
    various attacks, including packet sniffing, session hijacking, and content manipulation.
