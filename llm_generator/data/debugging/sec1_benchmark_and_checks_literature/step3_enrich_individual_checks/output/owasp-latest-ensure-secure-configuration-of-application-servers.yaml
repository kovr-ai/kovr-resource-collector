check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Insecure application server configurations can lead to exploitation for
      establishing a foothold on the system, which is covered by this technique.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Misconfigured application servers can expose sensitive data, which aligns
      with this technique of endpoint denial of service.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1499
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and monitor configuration
      settings for information systems, which includes application servers.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-6
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control mandates the implementation of least functionality, which
      involves disabling unnecessary services and features on application servers
      to reduce the attack surface.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-7
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement secure change management
      procedures, which includes securely configuring application servers during deployment
      and updates.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.1.2
  literature: Application servers are a critical component of modern web applications,
    handling requests, executing business logic, and serving content. Ensuring secure
    configuration of these servers is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, data
    breaches, and other security incidents. This check validates that application
    servers are configured securely, following industry best practices and hardening
    guidelines. Insecure configurations can lead to vulnerabilities such as unintended
    data exposure, remote code execution, and privilege escalation, which can be exploited
    by attackers to compromise the entire application and underlying infrastructure.
