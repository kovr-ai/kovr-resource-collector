  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the protection of information at rest, which includes
      the use of data masking techniques to obscure sensitive data.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-28
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the handling of assets, which includes the proper
      protection of sensitive data through techniques like data masking.

  literature: Data masking, also known as data obfuscation or data de-identification,
    is the process of hiding or obscuring sensitive data by replacing it with fictitious
    but realistic values. This technique is crucial for protecting sensitive information,
    such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or intellectual
    property, from unauthorized access or misuse. By implementing data masking, organizations
    can comply with data privacy regulations, mitigate the risk of data breaches,
    and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data during development,
    testing, or other non-production environments. Failure to properly mask sensitive
    data can lead to data leaks, identity theft, financial fraud, and regulatory fines.
