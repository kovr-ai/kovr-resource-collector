check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check can help detect
      and alert on the use of valid accounts for unauthorized or malicious purposes,
      which aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique 'Valid Accounts'.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: By monitoring for suspicious activities, the check can potentially detect
      and alert on brute-force attempts against systems or applications, which aligns
      with the MITRE ATT&CK technique 'Brute Force'.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: audit
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to monitor and analyze audit records
      for indications of potential unauthorized access or suspicious activities. The
      'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check directly aligns with
      this control by continuously monitoring for and detecting suspicious activities.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-6
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish event logging procedures
      and mechanisms to monitor user activities, exceptions, faults, and information
      security events. The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check
      supports this control by monitoring and detecting suspicious activities across
      various data sources.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.4.1
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to detect and alert on any suspicious or anomalous activities within an organization's
    systems and applications. It continuously monitors user behavior, system logs,
    network traffic, and other relevant data sources to identify potential security
    threats or unauthorized actions. This check is crucial because it helps organizations
    proactively identify and respond to potential security incidents, such as unauthorized
    access attempts, data exfiltration, or malicious insider activities. By monitoring
    for suspicious activities, organizations can take timely action to mitigate risks,
    investigate incidents, and prevent further damage or data breaches.
