  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Proper input validation and sanitization can help prevent command and
      script injection attacks, which are part of the 'Command and Scripting Interpreter'
      technique in MITRE ATT&CK.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1059
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Proper input validation and sanitization can help prevent server-side
      injection attacks, which are part of the 'Server Software Component' technique
      in MITRE ATT&CK.

  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the organization to implement input validation and
      sanitization mechanisms to prevent malicious code from being executed or data
      from being tampered with.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SI-10
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the organization to implement input validation and
      sanitization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to systems and data.

  literature: User input validation and sanitization is a critical security measure
    that helps prevent various types of attacks, such as injection attacks (e.g.,
    SQL injection, command injection, code injection), cross-site scripting (XSS),
    and other types of input-related vulnerabilities. Failing to properly validate
    and sanitize user input can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system
    compromise. This check ensures that all user input is thoroughly validated and
    sanitized before being processed or stored, reducing the risk of injection attacks
    and other input-related vulnerabilities.
