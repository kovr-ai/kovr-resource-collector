check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Enforcing least privilege principles can help mitigate the risk of valid
      accounts being misused or compromised by limiting the privileges associated
      with each account.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.75
    reason: Implementing least privilege can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
      data stored in cloud storage objects by limiting access permissions.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1530
  category: access_control
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.95
    reason: This control requires organizations to employ the principle of least privilege,
      allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of
      users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-6
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to restrict and control the allocation
      and use of access privileges, which aligns with the principle of least privilege.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.1.2
  literature: The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security concept that
    restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only those permissions
    required to perform authorized tasks. By enforcing least privilege, organizations
    can reduce their attack surface, limit potential damage from malicious actors,
    and mitigate the risks associated with excessive permissions. This check validates
    that systems and applications adhere to the least privilege principle, ensuring
    that users, processes, and services operate with the minimum necessary privileges
    to accomplish their intended functions, and no more. Implementing least privilege
    is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture and protecting sensitive
    data and systems from unauthorized access or misuse.
