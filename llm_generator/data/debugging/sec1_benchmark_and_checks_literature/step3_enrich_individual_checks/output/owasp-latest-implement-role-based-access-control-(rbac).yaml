    reason: MITRE ATT&CK technique T1078 (Valid Accounts) involves adversaries using
      valid accounts to gain initial access or elevate privileges. Implementing RBAC
      mitigates this technique by restricting access to authorized users and their
      assigned roles.

  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: MITRE ATT&CK technique T1530 (Data from Cloud Storage Object) involves
      adversaries accessing sensitive data stored in cloud storage. Implementing RBAC
      can help prevent unauthorized access to cloud storage by restricting access
      based on defined roles and permissions.

    reason: NIST 800-53 AC-3 (Access Control) requires organizations to enforce approved
      authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance
      with applicable access control policies. Implementing RBAC aligns with this
      control by ensuring that access is granted based on defined roles and permissions.

  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: ISO 27001 control A.9.2.3 (Management of Privileged Access Rights) requires
      the restriction and control of privileged access rights. Implementing RBAC helps
      manage and restrict access rights based on defined roles and responsibilities.

  literature: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security principle that restricts
    system access to authorized users based on their assigned roles and permissions.
    It is a fundamental security measure that helps prevent unauthorized access, data
    breaches, and misuse of system resources. By implementing RBAC, organizations
    can ensure that users only have access to the information and functionality they
    need to perform their job duties, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    This check validates that the application or system has implemented RBAC effectively,
    reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security incidents.
