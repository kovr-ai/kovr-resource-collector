  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Using industry-standard authentication protocols can help mitigate brute-force
      attacks by implementing strong password policies and rate-limiting mechanisms.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Using industry-standard authentication protocols can help prevent the
      use of valid accounts by unauthorized users by implementing strong authentication
      mechanisms.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  category: authentication
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the use of multifactor authentication for network
      access to non-privileged accounts, which aligns with the use of industry-standard
      authentication protocols.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-IA-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the use of authenticator management, which includes
      the use of industry-standard authentication protocols.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-IA-5
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the implementation of secure log-on procedures,
      which includes the use of industry-standard authentication protocols.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.2
  literature: The OWASP latest use industry standard authentication protocols check
    validates that the application uses industry-standard authentication protocols
    and mechanisms to authenticate users and protect their credentials. This is important
    because using weak or outdated authentication protocols can make the application
    vulnerable to various attacks, such as brute-force attacks, credential stuffing,
    and man-in-the-middle attacks. By using industry-standard authentication protocols
    like OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML, the application can ensure that user credentials
    are securely transmitted and stored, and that only authorized users can access
    the application's resources.
