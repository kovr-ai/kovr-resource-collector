check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Using outdated or insecure APIs can introduce vulnerabilities that can
      be exploited by adversaries to gain initial access or escalate privileges within
      a system.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.6
    reason: Outdated or insecure APIs may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited
      by adversaries to exfiltrate data from a system or network.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1499
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to develop, document, and periodically
      update system security plans that address information security requirements,
      including the use of secure and up-to-date software components.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SA-11
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and maintain policies
      and procedures for ensuring the security of application services on public networks,
      which includes using secure and up-to-date APIs and libraries.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.14.2.1
  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check validates that applications use
    the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities introduced
    by outdated or insecure code. Using outdated or insecure APIs can expose applications
    to known vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access,
    and other security incidents. This check is important because it helps ensure
    that applications are built with secure and up-to-date components, reducing the
    attack surface and minimizing the risk of exploitation.
