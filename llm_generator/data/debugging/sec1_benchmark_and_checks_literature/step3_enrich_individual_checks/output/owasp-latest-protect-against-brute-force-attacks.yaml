check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 1.0
    reason: This technique directly maps to brute force attacks, which the check aims
      to protect against.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: authentication
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to enforce access control policies
      and procedures to protect against unauthorized access, including brute force
      attacks.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-7
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement appropriate authentication
      mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access, including protection against
      brute force attacks.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.3
  literature: Brute force attacks are a common technique used by attackers to gain
    unauthorized access to systems or accounts by systematically trying all possible
    combinations of credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) until the correct
    one is found. This check validates that appropriate measures are in place to protect
    against such attacks, which can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and
    other security incidents. Implementing protection mechanisms like account lockouts,
    IP address blocking, and CAPTCHA challenges can significantly reduce the risk
    of successful brute force attacks.
