  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Insecure password recovery mechanisms can enable attackers to gain valid
      credentials and access to user accounts, which is a technique used in the Valid
      Accounts tactic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Weak password recovery mechanisms can enable attackers to perform brute-force
      attacks to guess or crack passwords, which is a technique used in the Brute
      Force tactic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: authentication
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to enforce strong authentication mechanisms,
      including secure password recovery processes, to protect against unauthorized
      access to information systems and data.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-7
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement secure password management
      processes, including secure password recovery mechanisms, to protect against
      unauthorized access to information systems and data.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.3
  literature: Secure password recovery mechanisms are essential for protecting user
    accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access. This check validates that
    the application implements robust and secure password recovery processes, such
    as sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using security
    questions. Insecure password recovery mechanisms can lead to account takeovers,
    data breaches, and other security incidents. Implementing secure password recovery
    mechanisms helps ensure that only authorized users can regain access to their
    accounts, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure.
