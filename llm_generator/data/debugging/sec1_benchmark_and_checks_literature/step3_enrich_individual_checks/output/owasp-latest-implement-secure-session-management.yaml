check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Secure session management helps prevent attackers from hijacking valid
      user sessions, which is a technique used in the Valid Accounts tactic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Secure session management, such as using unpredictable session identifiers,
      can help mitigate brute-force attacks on user sessions.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: access_control
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to employ mechanisms for identifying
      and authenticating users before establishing a session, which is directly related
      to secure session management.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-12
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to protect the confidentiality and
      integrity of session data, which is a key aspect of secure session management.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-23
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: This control requires organizations to restrict access to information
      and information processing facilities based on access control policies, which
      includes secure session management.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: Secure session management is a critical aspect of web application security.
    It involves protecting user sessions from unauthorized access, hijacking, and
    other attacks. This check validates that the application implements secure session
    management practices, such as generating unpredictable session identifiers, protecting
    session data from tampering, setting appropriate session timeouts, and invalidating
    sessions after logout or inactivity. Failure to implement secure session management
    can lead to session hijacking, unauthorized access, and other security vulnerabilities.
