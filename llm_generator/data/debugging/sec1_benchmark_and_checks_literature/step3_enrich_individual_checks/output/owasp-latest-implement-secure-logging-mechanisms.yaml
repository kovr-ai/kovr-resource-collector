  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Implementing secure logging mechanisms can help detect and mitigate user
      execution techniques, such as malicious scripts or commands executed by adversaries
      to achieve their objectives.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1204
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Secure logging mechanisms can help detect and investigate the use of valid
      accounts by adversaries to gain initial access or maintain persistence within
      a compromised environment.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Secure logging mechanisms can help detect and investigate techniques used
      by adversaries to inhibit system logging or clear existing logs to cover their
      tracks and impede incident response efforts.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1490
  category: audit
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement audit logging mechanisms
      to capture and maintain audit records for security-relevant events, including
      successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events,
      object access, policy change, privilege functions, and other events as defined
      by the organization.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to ensure the confidentiality, integrity,
      and availability of audit information and audit logging facilities, including
      protecting audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access,
      modification, and deletion.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-3
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish event logging mechanisms
      to record user activities, exceptions, faults, and information security events,
      and to ensure that log information is protected against tampering and unauthorized
      access.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.4.1
  literature: Secure logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining an audit trail,
    detecting security incidents, and troubleshooting issues in applications and systems.
    Proper logging practices involve capturing relevant information about user activities,
    system events, and security-related occurrences, while ensuring the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of log data. Implementing secure logging mechanisms
    helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements, forensic investigations,
    and incident response efforts. Failure to implement secure logging can lead to
    data breaches, unauthorized access, and an inability to reconstruct events or
    identify the root cause of security incidents.
