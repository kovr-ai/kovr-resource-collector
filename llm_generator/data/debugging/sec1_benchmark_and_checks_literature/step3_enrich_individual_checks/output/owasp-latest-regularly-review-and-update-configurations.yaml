  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Regularly reviewing and updating configurations can help prevent valid
      accounts from being compromised or misused due to outdated or insecure configurations.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Regularly reviewing and updating configurations can help mitigate the
      risk of adversaries exploiting misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access
      or escalate privileges.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and maintain baseline
      configurations and inventories of information systems, which includes regularly
      reviewing and updating configurations to maintain secure baselines.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-6
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement procedures to control
      the installation of software on operational systems, which includes regularly
      reviewing and updating configurations to ensure secure and authorized configurations.

  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    is designed to ensure that system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated
    to maintain a secure posture. As systems evolve and new vulnerabilities are discovered,
    it is crucial to keep configurations up-to-date to mitigate potential risks. Outdated
    configurations can introduce security vulnerabilities, expose sensitive data,
    or enable unauthorized access. Regular reviews and updates help identify and address
    misconfigurations, apply security patches, and align with the latest security
    best practices.
