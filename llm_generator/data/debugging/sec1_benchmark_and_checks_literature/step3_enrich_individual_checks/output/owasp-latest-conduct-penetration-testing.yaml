  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Penetration testing involves simulating various attack techniques, including
      those listed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, to identify vulnerabilities and
      test security controls.

  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to conduct penetration testing and
      red team exercises to identify vulnerabilities and evaluate the effectiveness
      of security controls.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CA-8
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to conduct regular security testing,
      including penetration testing, to assess the effectiveness of information security
      controls.

  literature: Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, is
    a simulated cyber attack against an organization's computer systems, networks,
    and web applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be
    exploited by malicious actors. It is an essential practice in cybersecurity to
    proactively identify and mitigate potential security risks before they can be
    exploited by real-world attackers. Conducting regular penetration testing helps
    organizations assess the effectiveness of their security controls, identify gaps
    in their defenses, and prioritize remediation efforts. By simulating real-world
    attack scenarios, penetration testing provides valuable insights into an organization's
    security posture and helps strengthen its overall cybersecurity resilience.
