check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Insecure default configurations can allow attackers to leverage valid
      accounts and gain unauthorized access to systems and data.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Insecure default configurations can enable unnecessary services or features
      that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and document configuration
      settings for information technology products employed within the information
      system. Secure defaults help ensure that systems are configured with approved
      and secure settings.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-6
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement procedures to control
      the installation of software on operational systems. Secure defaults help ensure
      that software is installed with secure configurations and settings.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.1.2
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check validates that applications
    and systems are configured with secure default settings and configurations. Many
    software products and services come with default configurations that prioritize
    ease of use and functionality over security. These default settings often have
    known vulnerabilities, weak security controls, or unnecessary services enabled,
    which can expose the system to various security risks. By enforcing secure defaults,
    this check helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    other security incidents caused by insecure configurations.
