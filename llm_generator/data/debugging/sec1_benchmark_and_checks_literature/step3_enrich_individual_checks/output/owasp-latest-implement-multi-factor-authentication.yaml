  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Implementing MFA helps mitigate the risk of valid account credentials
      being compromised and used for unauthorized access (MITRE ATT&CK T1078 - Valid
      Accounts).
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: MFA can help prevent brute-force attacks (MITRE ATT&CK T1110) by requiring
      additional authentication factors beyond just a password.

  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: NIST 800-53 IA-2 (Identification and Authentication - Organizational Users)
      requires the use of multi-factor authentication for network access to non-privileged
      accounts.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-IA-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: ISO 27001 control A.9.4.2 (User authentication for external connections)
      requires the implementation of appropriate authentication methods to control
      access by remote users.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.2
  literature: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires
    users to provide two or more forms of authentication to verify their identity
    before granting access to a system, application, or resource. This check validates
    that MFA is implemented and enforced for all user accounts, ensuring an additional
    layer of security beyond just a password. MFA significantly reduces the risk of
    unauthorized access, even if one factor (e.g., a password) is compromised. It
    is an essential security control to protect against various attack vectors, such
    as brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and phishing attempts.
