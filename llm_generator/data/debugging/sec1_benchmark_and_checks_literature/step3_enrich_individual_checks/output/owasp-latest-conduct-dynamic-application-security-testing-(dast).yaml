  literature: 'Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a technique used to
    identify security vulnerabilities in web applications by simulating real-world
    attacks and analyzing the application''s behavior and responses. DAST tools interact
    with the running application from the outside, mimicking the actions of a malicious
    user or attacker. This approach helps uncover vulnerabilities that may be missed
    by static code analysis or other testing methods.


    The importance of conducting DAST lies in its ability to detect vulnerabilities
    that can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or system compromise. By
    simulating real-world attacks, DAST tools can identify issues such as injection
    flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, XML external entities (XXE),
    and other security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.


    Regular DAST testing is crucial for organizations to ensure the security of their
    web applications, especially those handling sensitive data or providing critical
    services. It helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited,
    reducing the risk of data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.'
