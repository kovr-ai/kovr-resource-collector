  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Implementing strong password requirements helps mitigate the risk of brute-force
      attacks, which are a common technique used by attackers to gain unauthorized
      access to systems and data.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Strong password requirements help prevent attackers from using valid accounts
      with weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to systems and data.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  category: authentication
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the organization to enforce approved authentication
      methods, including password strength requirements, to ensure the confidentiality
      and integrity of information.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-IA-5
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the implementation of effective password management
      practices, including password strength requirements, to protect against unauthorized
      access.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.3
  literature: Password strength requirements are a critical security control that
    helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to systems and data. Weak passwords
    are susceptible to brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and other password
    cracking techniques, which can lead to compromised accounts and data breaches.
    Implementing strong password requirements, such as minimum length, complexity
    rules, and regular password changes, significantly increases the effort required
    for an attacker to guess or crack a password. This check validates that the latest
    OWASP password strength recommendations are implemented, ensuring that passwords
    meet industry-standard security requirements.
