  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve code
      execution, which is a technique used in this MITRE ATT&CK tactic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1059
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain unauthorized
      access to sensitive data, which is a technique used in this MITRE ATT&CK tactic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1212
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the organization to validate and sanitize all input
      data, including serialized data, to prevent the execution of malicious code
      or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SI-10
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the implementation of measures to protect against
      malicious code, which includes validating and sanitizing serialized data to
      prevent code injection or execution.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.13.1.3
  literature: Serialized data, such as objects or data structures, can contain sensitive
    information or executable code. If this data is not properly validated and sanitized,
    it can lead to various security vulnerabilities like code injection, data tampering,
    or unauthorized access. This check ensures that all serialized data is thoroughly
    validated and sanitized before being processed or deserialized, mitigating the
    risk of attacks that exploit insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
