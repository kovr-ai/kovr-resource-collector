  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Implementing secure software supply chain practices can help mitigate
      the risk of supply chain compromise, which is a technique used by adversaries
      to introduce malicious code or vulnerabilities into software or hardware components.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1195
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Secure software supply chain practices can help prevent adversaries from
      exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party software or components used in the
      organization's systems.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1598
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement software supply chain
      security practices to protect against the introduction of malicious code or
      vulnerabilities during the software development and acquisition process.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SA-10
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and implement procedures
      for secure software development and acquisition, including secure software supply
      chain practices.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.14.2.7
  literature: Secure software supply chain practices are essential for ensuring the
    integrity and security of software throughout its entire lifecycle, from development
    to deployment. This check validates that organizations have implemented robust
    processes and controls to protect their software supply chain from potential threats
    and vulnerabilities. A compromised software supply chain can lead to the introduction
    of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities, which can have severe consequences
    for the organization's systems and data. By implementing secure software supply
    chain practices, organizations can mitigate risks such as software tampering,
    unauthorized access, and supply chain attacks.
