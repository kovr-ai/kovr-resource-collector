check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Unsecured credentials, including encryption keys, can be exploited by
      adversaries to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1552
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Weak or improperly managed encryption keys can enable adversaries to access
      and exfiltrate sensitive data from cloud storage.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1537
  category: encryption
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and manage cryptographic
      keys for encryption and decryption operations, which is directly related to
      secure key management.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-12
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to use cryptographic protection for
      information at rest, which involves secure key management practices.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-13
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement key management practices
      to support the use of cryptographic controls for protection of information.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.10.1.2
  literature: Secure key management is a critical aspect of ensuring the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Keys are used to encrypt and decrypt
    data, authenticate users and systems, and ensure the integrity of data transmissions.
    Improper key management can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other
    security incidents. This check validates that an application or system implements
    secure key management practices, such as using strong encryption algorithms, properly
    generating and storing keys, regularly rotating keys, and securely distributing
    keys to authorized parties. Failure to implement secure key management can result
    in data exposure, unauthorized access, and other security risks.
