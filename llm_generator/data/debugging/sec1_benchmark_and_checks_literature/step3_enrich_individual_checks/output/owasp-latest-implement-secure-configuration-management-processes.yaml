check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Secure configuration management processes help prevent unauthorized access
      and misuse of valid accounts, which is a technique used by adversaries.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.6
    reason: Secure configuration management processes can help prevent successful
      brute-force attacks by ensuring that systems are properly configured and hardened.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement baseline configuration
      and inventory of information systems, which is a fundamental aspect of secure
      configuration management processes.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-2
  - confidence: 1.0
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement configuration change
      control processes, which is directly related to the secure configuration management
      processes being validated by this check.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-3
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement change management procedures,
      which aligns with the secure configuration management processes being validated
      by this check.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.1.2
  literature: Secure configuration management processes are essential for maintaining
    the integrity and security of systems and applications. This check validates that
    organizations have implemented robust processes for managing configuration changes,
    including tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes in a controlled
    manner. Failure to implement secure configuration management processes can lead
    to unauthorized or unintended changes, which can introduce vulnerabilities, system
    instability, and compliance issues. Secure configuration management processes
    help ensure that changes are properly reviewed, tested, and approved before deployment,
    reducing the risk of security incidents and system outages.
