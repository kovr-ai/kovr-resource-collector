  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Keeping software up-to-date with security patches helps mitigate the risk
      of attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain initial access or escalate
      privileges.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Applying security patches and updates helps prevent attackers from exploiting
      vulnerabilities to maintain persistence or escalate privileges within the compromised
      environment.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1499
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to identify, report, and correct information
      system flaws in a timely manner, which includes applying security patches and
      updates to address known vulnerabilities.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SI-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to manage vulnerabilities and apply
      appropriate security patches and updates to address identified vulnerabilities
      in a timely manner.

  literature: Keeping software up-to-date with the latest security patches is a critical
    security practice that helps mitigate the risk of known vulnerabilities being
    exploited by attackers. Software vendors regularly release updates and patches
    to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other issues.
    Failing to apply these patches leaves systems and applications vulnerable to potential
    attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents. This check validates that
    software and systems are regularly updated with the latest security patches to
    ensure that known vulnerabilities are addressed and the overall security posture
    is maintained.
