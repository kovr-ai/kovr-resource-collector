    reason: Using insecure XML parsers can lead to XXE vulnerabilities, which are
      part of the 'Exploitation for Client Execution' technique in MITRE ATT&CK.

  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the organization to employ software input validation
      techniques to prevent malicious code from being executed. Using secure XML parsers
      is a form of input validation that helps prevent XML-based attacks.

  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the organization to implement controls to prevent
      and detect malicious code. Using secure XML parsers helps prevent XML-based
      attacks that could introduce malicious code.

  literature: XML parsers are used to process and manipulate XML data. Insecure XML
    parsers can be vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as XML External Entity
    (XXE) attacks, XML Injection, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. These vulnerabilities
    can lead to sensitive data exposure, unauthorized access, or system crashes. Using
    secure XML parsers that are properly configured and validated can mitigate these
    risks and ensure the safe handling of XML data.
