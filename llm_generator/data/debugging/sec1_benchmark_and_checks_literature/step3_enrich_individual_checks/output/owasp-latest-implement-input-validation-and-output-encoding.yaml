  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common attack technique that can be mitigated
      by implementing input validation and output encoding, which is the focus of
      this security check.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1059
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, such as those caused by
      lack of input validation and output encoding, is a common attack technique that
      can be mitigated by implementing this security check.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement input validation and
      output encoding to prevent code injection vulnerabilities, which aligns with
      the purpose of this security check.

  literature: Input validation and output encoding are critical security measures
    to prevent various types of code injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting
    (XSS), SQL Injection, and Command Injection. Input validation ensures that user-supplied
    data is properly sanitized and validated before being processed by the application,
    while output encoding ensures that any user-supplied data is properly encoded
    before being rendered in the application's output (e.g., web pages, API responses).
    Failure to implement these measures can lead to severe security vulnerabilities
    that allow attackers to execute malicious code, access or modify sensitive data,
    or perform other unauthorized actions.
