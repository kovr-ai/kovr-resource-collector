check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Having a plan for addressing vulnerabilities can help mitigate the risk
      of exploitation of vulnerabilities, which is a common technique used by adversaries
      in the 'Exploit Public-Facing Application' tactic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.6
    reason: Failing to address vulnerabilities in a timely manner can increase the
      risk of adversaries exploiting those vulnerabilities to gain a foothold in the
      organization's systems, which is a common technique used in the 'Endpoint Denial
      of Service' tactic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1499
  category: risk_assessment
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to develop and maintain a plan of
      action and milestones for addressing vulnerabilities, which aligns with the
      purpose of the 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' check.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-RA-5
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to have appropriate processes and
      procedures for managing information security incidents, including vulnerabilities,
      which aligns with the purpose of the 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities'
      check.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.16.1.3
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' check
    is designed to ensure that organizations have a well-defined and documented plan
    for addressing vulnerabilities discovered in their applications and systems. Vulnerabilities
    can pose significant risks to an organization's security posture, potentially
    leading to data breaches, system compromises, and other security incidents. Having
    a plan in place for addressing vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining the
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization's information
    assets. This check validates that such a plan exists and is regularly reviewed
    and updated to reflect the evolving threat landscape and organizational needs.
