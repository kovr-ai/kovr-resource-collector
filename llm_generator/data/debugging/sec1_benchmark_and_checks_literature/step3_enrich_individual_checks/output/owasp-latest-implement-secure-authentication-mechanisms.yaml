check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms helps mitigate the risk
      of valid accounts being compromised and used for unauthorized access.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Secure authentication mechanisms help protect against brute-force attacks,
      which attempt to gain unauthorized access by guessing credentials.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: authentication
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to enforce access control policies
      and procedures, which includes implementing secure authentication mechanisms
      to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-3
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement access control policies
      and procedures to restrict access to information and information processing
      facilities, which includes implementing secure authentication mechanisms.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: The OWASP latest secure authentication mechanisms check validates that
    the application implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect against
    common authentication attacks such as brute-force, credential stuffing, and session
    hijacking. Proper authentication is crucial for ensuring that only authorized
    users can access sensitive data and functionality within the application. Implementing
    secure authentication mechanisms helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access,
    data breaches, and other security incidents.
