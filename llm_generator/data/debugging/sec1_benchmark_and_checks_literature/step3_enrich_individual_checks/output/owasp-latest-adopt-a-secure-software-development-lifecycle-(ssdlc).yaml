check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Adopting an SSDLC can help mitigate the risk of supply chain compromise
      by ensuring that security is considered throughout the software development
      process, including the vetting of third-party components and libraries.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1195
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: An SSDLC can help identify and address vulnerabilities in software before
      it is deployed, reducing the risk of exploitation by adversaries.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1499
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to develop, document, and implement
      a system development life cycle that incorporates information security considerations.
      Adopting an SSDLC aligns with this control.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SA-3
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and maintain policies
      and procedures for secure development, which includes adopting an SSDLC.

  literature: The OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of
    best practices and guidelines for building secure software from the ground up.
    It emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations throughout
    the entire software development process, from requirements gathering and design
    to implementation, testing, and deployment. By adopting an SSDLC, organizations
    can proactively address security risks and vulnerabilities, rather than reactively
    addressing them after the software is released. This check validates whether an
    organization has adopted and follows a secure SSDLC, which is crucial for developing
    secure and resilient applications that can withstand various cyber threats.
