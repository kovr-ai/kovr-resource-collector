check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Encrypting data in transit can help mitigate the risk of network sniffing,
      which is a technique used by attackers to capture and analyze network traffic.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1040
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Encrypting data in transit can help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks,
      where an attacker intercepts and potentially modifies the communication between
      two parties.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1557
  category: encryption
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the implementation of mechanisms to protect the
      confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information, which aligns with
      the objective of encrypting data in transit.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-8
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the implementation of network controls to protect
      information in networks and the supporting information processing facilities,
      which includes encrypting data in transit.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.13.1.1
  literature: Data in transit refers to any data that is being transmitted across
    a network or communication channel. Implementing encryption for data in transit
    is a crucial security measure to protect sensitive information from being intercepted
    or eavesdropped by unauthorized parties. Without proper encryption, data transmitted
    over networks can be easily captured and read by attackers, leading to data breaches
    and compromised confidentiality. Encrypting data in transit ensures that even
    if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable and secure, preventing unauthorized
    access and maintaining data integrity. This check validates that appropriate encryption
    mechanisms are in place for all data transmissions, ensuring the confidentiality
    and integrity of sensitive information during transit.
