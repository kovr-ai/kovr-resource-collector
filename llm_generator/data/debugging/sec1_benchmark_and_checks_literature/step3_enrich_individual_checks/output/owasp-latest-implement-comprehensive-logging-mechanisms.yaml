  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Comprehensive logging mechanisms can help detect and investigate the use
      of valid accounts by adversaries, providing a trail of evidence for account
      activities.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Logging mechanisms can capture data access and transfer activities, including
      access to cloud storage objects, enabling detection and investigation of potential
      data exfiltration attempts.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1530
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Comprehensive logging can help detect and investigate brute-force attacks
      by capturing failed authentication attempts and other related events.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: audit
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement audit logging mechanisms
      to capture and maintain audit records for security-relevant events, including
      successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management activities,
      and other system-level events.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control mandates the content of audit records, ensuring that comprehensive
      information is captured, including event descriptions, event sources, event
      times, and other relevant details.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-3
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish event logging mechanisms
      to record user activities, exceptions, faults, and information security events.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.4.1
  literature: Comprehensive logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining visibility
    into system activities, detecting potential security incidents, and enabling effective
    incident response and forensic analysis. Logging captures detailed information
    about user actions, system events, and security-related activities, providing
    a trail of evidence that can be used to investigate and respond to security breaches,
    policy violations, or operational issues. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
    helps organizations meet compliance requirements, identify and mitigate risks,
    and maintain accountability. Without proper logging, it becomes challenging to
    detect and respond to security incidents, leaving systems vulnerable to various
    threats.
