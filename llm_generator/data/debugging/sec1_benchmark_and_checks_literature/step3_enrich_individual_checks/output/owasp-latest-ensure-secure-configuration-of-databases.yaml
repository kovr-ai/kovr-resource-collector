check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Insecure database configurations can allow attackers to gain unauthorized
      access to valid accounts, enabling them to access sensitive data or perform
      malicious actions. Ensuring secure database configuration helps mitigate this
      risk.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Databases often store sensitive data in cloud storage objects. Insecure
      database configurations can allow attackers to access and exfiltrate this data.
      Secure database configuration helps prevent unauthorized access and data theft.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1530
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Weak authentication mechanisms or insecure configurations in databases
      can make them vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Ensuring secure database configuration,
      including strong authentication and access controls, helps mitigate this risk.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: access_control
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to enforce access control policies
      and procedures to limit access to information systems and data. Ensuring secure
      configuration of databases aligns with this control by restricting unauthorized
      access to sensitive data stored in databases.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-3
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control mandates the protection of information at rest, which includes
      data stored in databases. Secure database configuration helps ensure that sensitive
      data is protected from unauthorized access or modification, aligning with this
      control.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-28
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement access control policies
      and procedures to restrict access to information and information processing
      facilities. Secure database configuration helps enforce access restrictions
      and protect sensitive data stored in databases, aligning with this control.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: Databases often store sensitive information that must be protected from
    unauthorized access or modification. Ensuring secure configuration of databases
    is crucial to prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential system
    compromises. This check validates that databases are configured securely, following
    industry best practices and security guidelines. It examines various aspects of
    database configuration, such as authentication mechanisms, access controls, encryption
    settings, auditing, and logging. Proper database configuration helps mitigate
    risks associated with data exposure, unauthorized access, and potential data tampering.
