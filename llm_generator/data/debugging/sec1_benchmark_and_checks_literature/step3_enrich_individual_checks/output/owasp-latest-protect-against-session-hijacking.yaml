  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Session hijacking is a technique used by adversaries to gain unauthorized
      access to systems or data by stealing or guessing valid session tokens or IDs.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1550
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Session hijacking can be used by adversaries to impersonate legitimate
      users and gain unauthorized access to systems or data using valid accounts.

  category: authentication
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the implementation of session management mechanisms
      to protect against session hijacking and unauthorized access.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-12
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the implementation of session authenticity mechanisms
      to protect against session hijacking and unauthorized access.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-23
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the implementation of access control mechanisms,
      including session management, to restrict unauthorized access to information
      systems and data.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: Session hijacking is a type of attack where an attacker takes control
    of an authenticated user's session by stealing or guessing the session token or
    session ID. This can allow the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user and
    gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform actions on their behalf.
    Protecting against session hijacking is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of web applications and preventing unauthorized access.
    This check validates that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate the risk
    of session hijacking attacks, such as using secure session management practices,
    implementing session timeouts, and protecting session tokens from being exposed
    or guessed.
