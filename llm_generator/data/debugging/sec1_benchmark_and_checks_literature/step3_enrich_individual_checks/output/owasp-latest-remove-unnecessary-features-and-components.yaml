check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Removing unnecessary features and components can help mitigate the risk
      of attackers exploiting exposed functionality for privilege escalation or lateral
      movement.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Unnecessary features and components can potentially be leveraged by attackers
      to gain a foothold or persist within the system, making their removal a defensive
      measure.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1499
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to configure systems and components
      to provide only essential capabilities, which aligns with the goal of removing
      unnecessary features and components.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-7
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control emphasizes the need to restrict software installation on
      operational systems, which can be achieved by removing unnecessary features
      and components.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.2
  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'
    aims to ensure that applications and systems do not expose unnecessary features,
    components, or functionality that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
    Unnecessary features and components can introduce security vulnerabilities, increase
    the attack surface, and provide entry points for malicious actors. By removing
    or disabling these unnecessary elements, the overall security posture of the application
    or system is improved, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches,
    or other security incidents.
