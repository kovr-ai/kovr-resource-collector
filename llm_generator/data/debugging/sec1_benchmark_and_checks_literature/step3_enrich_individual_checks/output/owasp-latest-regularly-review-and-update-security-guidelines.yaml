  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Regularly reviewing and updating security guidelines based on industry
      standards like OWASP Top 10 can help mitigate the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities
      in web applications, which is a common attack vector covered by the 'Exploit
      Public-Facing Application' technique in MITRE ATT&CK.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Failing to regularly review and update security guidelines based on industry
      standards like OWASP Top 10 can leave web applications vulnerable to known and
      emerging threats, potentially enabling adversaries to exploit these vulnerabilities
      for 'Endpoint Denial of Service' attacks.

  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to develop and maintain a system security
      plan that addresses information security throughout the system development life
      cycle. Regularly reviewing and updating security guidelines based on industry
      standards like OWASP Top 10 is a key aspect of maintaining a comprehensive system
      security plan.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-PL-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and maintain policies
      and procedures for information security risk assessment. Regularly reviewing
      and updating security guidelines based on industry standards like OWASP Top
      10 is a critical aspect of identifying and mitigating information security risks.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.14.2.1
  literature: The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized standard for web application
    security. It represents a broad consensus on the most critical web application
    security risks. Regularly reviewing and updating security guidelines based on
    the OWASP Top 10 is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture. As new
    vulnerabilities and attack vectors emerge, security guidelines must evolve to
    address these threats effectively. Failing to update security guidelines can leave
    applications vulnerable to known and emerging risks, potentially leading to data
    breaches, system compromises, and other security incidents.
