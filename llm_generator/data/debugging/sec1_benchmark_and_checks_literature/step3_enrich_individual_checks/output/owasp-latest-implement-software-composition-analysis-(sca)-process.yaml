    reason: Implementing an SCA process can help organizations identify and mitigate
      the risk of supply chain compromise, which is a technique used by adversaries
      to introduce malicious code or vulnerabilities into software components.

    reason: Implementing an SCA process can help organizations identify and mitigate
      the risk of software vulnerabilities being exploited by adversaries to gain
      initial access or escalate privileges.

  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to develop and implement a software
      composition analysis process to identify and manage the use of third-party software
      components, including open source software, in their systems and applications.

  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and maintain policies
      and procedures for ensuring the security of information and software assets,
      which includes implementing processes for identifying and managing the use of
      third-party software components.

  literature: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a process that identifies and
    analyzes the open source and third-party components used in an application. It
    helps organizations understand the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated
    with these components, enabling them to make informed decisions about their use
    and take appropriate mitigation measures. Implementing an SCA process is crucial
    because it helps organizations maintain the security, compliance, and quality
    of their software by identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities, license
    compliance issues, and outdated or unsupported components. By regularly scanning
    their applications for known vulnerabilities and licensing issues, organizations
    can proactively address these risks and reduce the likelihood of security breaches,
    legal issues, and other problems.
