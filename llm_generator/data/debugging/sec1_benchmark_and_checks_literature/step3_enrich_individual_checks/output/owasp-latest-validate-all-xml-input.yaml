check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This technique involves exploiting XML vulnerabilities, such as XXE and
      XML injection, which can be mitigated by validating and sanitizing XML input.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1211
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software libraries,
      which can include XML parsing libraries. Validating XML input can help prevent
      such exploits.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to validate and sanitize input data
      to prevent malicious code from being executed. Validating XML input is a crucial
      step in ensuring the integrity and security of the application.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SI-10
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement measures to protect against
      malicious code, which includes validating and sanitizing input data, such as
      XML input.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.13.1.3
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' check is designed to validate
    all XML input received by an application to prevent various types of XML-based
    attacks. XML is a widely used data format for exchanging structured information,
    and it is crucial to validate and sanitize XML input to mitigate risks such as
    XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML injection, and other XML-related vulnerabilities.
    Failing to properly validate XML input can lead to data leaks, unauthorized access,
    denial of service, and remote code execution, depending on the context and the
    application's functionality.
