  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Comprehensive monitoring mechanisms can help detect and respond to the
      use of valid accounts by adversaries for malicious purposes.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Monitoring mechanisms can help detect and respond to unauthorized access
      or exfiltration of data from cloud storage objects.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1530
  - confidence: 0.6
    reason: Comprehensive monitoring mechanisms can help detect and respond to brute-force
      attacks against systems or applications.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  category: audit
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish an audit monitoring,
      analysis, and reporting capability for organizational systems, which aligns
      with the implementation of comprehensive monitoring mechanisms.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AU-6
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish event logging procedures,
      which is a key component of comprehensive monitoring mechanisms.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.4.1
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: This control requires organizations to monitor system security alerts
      and advisories, which is facilitated by comprehensive monitoring mechanisms.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SI-4
  literature: Comprehensive monitoring mechanisms are essential for detecting and
    responding to security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and potential
    data breaches. This check validates that an organization has implemented robust
    monitoring systems that can track and log various activities across its infrastructure,
    applications, and user interactions. Effective monitoring enables organizations
    to identify anomalies, suspicious behavior, and potential threats in a timely
    manner, allowing for prompt investigation and mitigation. Without comprehensive
    monitoring, organizations may remain unaware of security incidents, leaving them
    vulnerable to data breaches, system compromises, and regulatory non-compliance.
