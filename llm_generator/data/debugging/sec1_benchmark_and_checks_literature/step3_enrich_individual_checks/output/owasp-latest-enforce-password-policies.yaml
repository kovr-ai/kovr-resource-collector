check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Enforcing strong password policies can help mitigate the risk of brute-force
      attacks, where attackers attempt to guess valid credentials through automated
      or manual methods.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1110
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Weak or compromised passwords can enable attackers to gain unauthorized
      access to valid accounts, potentially leading to further malicious activities
      within the system.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1078
  category: authentication
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to enforce specific configuration
      settings for authentication mechanisms, including password policies, to manage
      the risk of unauthorized access.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-IA-5
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement effective password management
      practices, including enforcing password policies, to protect access credentials.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.9.4.3
  literature: Password policies are a set of rules and requirements that govern the
    creation, usage, and management of passwords within an organization or system.
    These policies aim to enhance the security of authentication mechanisms by enforcing
    strong password practices, reducing the risk of password guessing or cracking
    attacks, and mitigating the potential impact of compromised credentials. Implementing
    robust password policies is crucial for protecting sensitive information, maintaining
    system integrity, and preventing unauthorized access. This security check validates
    the existence and enforcement of strong password policies, which typically include
    requirements such as minimum password length, complexity rules, password expiration
    periods, and restrictions on password reuse.
