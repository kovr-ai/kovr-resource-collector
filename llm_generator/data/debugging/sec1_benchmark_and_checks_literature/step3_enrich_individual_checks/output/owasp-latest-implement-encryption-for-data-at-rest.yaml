check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Encrypting data at rest can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to
      data stored in cloud storage objects.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1530
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Encrypting data at rest can prevent threat actors from stealing sensitive
      data stored on compromised systems or removable media.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1558
  category: encryption
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control specifically addresses the protection of information at rest,
      which includes implementing encryption for data stored on digital media.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SC-28
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the implementation of appropriate controls to protect
      data from unauthorized disclosure or misuse, which can be achieved through encryption
      of data at rest.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.10.1.1
  literature: Data at rest refers to inactive data stored on any digital medium, such
    as hard drives, databases, cloud storage, or backup tapes. Implementing encryption
    for data at rest is a crucial security measure to protect sensitive information
    from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats. Unencrypted data at
    rest is vulnerable to theft, misuse, or exposure, which can lead to severe consequences
    like identity theft, financial loss, and regulatory non-compliance. Encrypting
    data at rest ensures that even if an attacker gains physical access to the storage
    medium, the data remains unintelligible and unusable without the proper decryption
    keys. This check validates that encryption is implemented for all data at rest,
    following industry-standard encryption algorithms and key management practices.
