    output_statements:
      failure: S3 bucket logging is not enabled, which may limit visibility into access
        requests and activities.
      partial: Some S3 buckets have logging enabled, while others do not, resulting
        in partial visibility into access requests and activities.
      success: S3 bucket logging is enabled, providing comprehensive logging mechanisms
        for monitoring access and activities.
