      instructions:
      - 1. Enable and configure the GitHub Advanced Security features, including Dependabot
        alerts, code scanning, and secret scanning.
      - 2. Set up regular scans for vulnerabilities, dependencies, and security advisories
        using the GitHub API or third-party tools.
      - 3. Review and address any identified vulnerabilities, licensing issues, or
        outdated components.
      - 4. Establish a process for monitoring and responding to new vulnerabilities
        and security advisories as they are released.
