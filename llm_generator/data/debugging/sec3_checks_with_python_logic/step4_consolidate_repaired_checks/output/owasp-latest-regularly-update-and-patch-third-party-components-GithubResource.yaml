        they should be addressed by updating or patching the affected components.
      estimated_time: 30 minutes to 2 hours
      instructions:
      - Review the security_data.vulnerability_alerts and security_data.security_advisories
        fields to identify vulnerable dependencies.
      - Check the project's dependency management system (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt)
        for available updates or patches.
      - Update or patch the affected dependencies according to the project's update
        process.
      - Verify that the vulnerabilities have been resolved by checking the security_data
        fields again.
