      instructions:
      - Review the admin_info fields (isAdmin, isDelegatedAdmin) and organizational_info.orgUnitPath
        to identify administrative users and organizational unit hierarchy.
      - Define and implement role-based access control (RBAC) policies based on the
        identified administrative users and organizational units.
      - Regularly review and update access control policies to ensure they align with
        the principle of least privilege and reflect changes in user roles and responsibilities.
      - Implement additional access control measures, such as attribute-based access
        control (ABAC) or multi-factor authentication (MFA), as needed for enhanced
        security.

    output_statements:
      failure: Proper access control mechanisms have not been implemented for the
        UserResource, leaving sensitive data and resources vulnerable to unauthorized
        access.
      partial: Access control mechanisms have been partially implemented for the UserResource,
        but further improvements are required to ensure comprehensive protection against
        unauthorized access.
      success: Proper access control mechanisms have been implemented for the UserResource,
        ensuring that only authorized users can access and perform operations on sensitive
        data and resources.
