      automation_available: true
      description: To address this security check, you need to establish a process
        for monitoring security advisories from software vendors, security researchers,
        and other relevant sources.
      estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing effort for monitoring and
        addressing advisories
      instructions:
      - Identify the software and services used within your organization and their
        respective vendors or sources for security advisories.
      - Subscribe to mailing lists, RSS feeds, or other notification channels provided
        by these vendors or sources.
      - Implement a process for reviewing and acting upon received security advisories,
        such as patching or mitigating identified vulnerabilities.
      - Consider using a centralized vulnerability management solution to streamline
        the process of monitoring and addressing security advisories.

      failure: CloudTrail is not configured to log relevant events and data resources,
        and no process is in place to monitor for security advisories from external
        sources.
      partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to log relevant events and data
        resources, but a comprehensive process for monitoring security advisories
        from external sources is missing.
      success: CloudTrail is configured to log relevant events and data resources,
        and a process is in place to monitor for security advisories from external
        sources.
