      description: If access control issues are identified, it is crucial to review
        and update the server-side logic and configurations to ensure that only authorized
        users or entities can access and modify user data based on their assigned
        privileges and security settings.
      estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial review and basic fixes, but ongoing maintenance
        and updates may be required.
      instructions:
      - Review the server-side code and configurations related to user authentication,
        authorization, and access control mechanisms.
      - Implement proper checks and validations to ensure that only users with the
        appropriate administrative privileges or security settings can access and
        modify sensitive user data.
      - Regularly review and update access control policies and configurations to
        align with the latest security best practices and organizational requirements.
      - Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to potential
        access control violations or unauthorized access attempts.

    output_statements:
      failure: Access controls for the UserResource are not properly implemented on
        the server-side, allowing unauthorized access or modification of sensitive
        user data.
      partial: Access controls for the UserResource are partially implemented on the
        server-side, but some issues or gaps were identified that could lead to unauthorized
        access or modification of sensitive user data.
      success: Access controls for the UserResource are properly implemented on the
        server-side, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify sensitive
        user data.
