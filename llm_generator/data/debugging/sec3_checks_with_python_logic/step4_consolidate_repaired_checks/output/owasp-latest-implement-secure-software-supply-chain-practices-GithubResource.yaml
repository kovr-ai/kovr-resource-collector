      description: 'If the repository is found to be lacking in secure software supply
        chain practices, the following steps can be taken to remediate the issues:'
      estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance required
      instructions:
      - Review and configure GitHub Actions workflows for automated build, testing,
        and deployment processes.
      - Implement proper access controls and permissions for collaborators based on
        the principle of least privilege.
      - Enable and configure security features like Dependabot for dependency scanning,
        CodeQL for code analysis, and secret scanning for detecting exposed secrets.
      - Review and address any identified security advisories or vulnerability alerts.
      - Establish processes and documentation for maintaining secure software supply
        chain practices throughout the repository's lifecycle.

    output_statements:
      failure: The repository lacks proper implementation of secure software supply
        chain practices. Automated workflows, access controls, and security scanning
        capabilities are missing or misconfigured.
      partial: The repository has partially implemented secure software supply chain
        practices, but there are areas that require further attention and improvement.
      success: The repository has implemented secure software supply chain practices,
        including automated workflows, access controls, and security scanning.
