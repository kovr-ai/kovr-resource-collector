      description: Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms for all
        user-provided data in the UserResource.
      estimated_time: 2-4 hours
      instructions:
      - Identify all fields that accept user input, including contact_info.emails[].address,
        contact_info.phones[].value, and profile_info.languages[].languageCode.
      - Implement input validation rules to ensure that user input conforms to expected
        formats and does not contain malicious characters or patterns.
      - Sanitize user input by removing or encoding potentially dangerous characters
        or patterns before storing or processing the data.
      - Update the application code to use the validated and sanitized input values
        instead of the raw user input.
      - Implement regular testing and monitoring to ensure the input validation and
        sanitization mechanisms are working as intended.

    output_statements:
      failure: One or more user input fields in the UserResource are not being properly
        validated and sanitized, leaving the system vulnerable to injection attacks
        and other input-related vulnerabilities.
      partial: Some user input fields in the UserResource are being validated and
        sanitized, but others are not, leaving the system partially vulnerable to
        injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
      success: All user input fields in the UserResource are properly validated and
        sanitized, mitigating the risk of injection attacks and other input-related
        vulnerabilities.
