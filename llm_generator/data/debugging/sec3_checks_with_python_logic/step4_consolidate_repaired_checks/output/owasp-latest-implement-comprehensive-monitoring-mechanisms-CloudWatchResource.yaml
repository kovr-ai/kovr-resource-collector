      description: 'If the AWS CloudWatch resource is not configured with comprehensive
        monitoring mechanisms, the following steps can be taken to remediate the issue:'
      estimated_time: 1-2 hours
      instructions:
      - 1. Review the existing CloudWatch alarms and ensure they cover critical metrics
        and resources relevant to security monitoring.
      - 2. Create additional alarms for monitoring security-related metrics, such
        as unauthorized access attempts, suspicious user activities, and potential
        data breaches.
      - 3. Configure CloudWatch Logs to collect and analyze log data from relevant
        AWS services and applications for security-related events.
      - 4. Create CloudWatch Dashboards to visualize and monitor security-related
        metrics and log data in a centralized view.
      - 5. Integrate CloudWatch with other security monitoring tools or services for
        advanced threat detection and incident response capabilities.

    output_statements:
      failure: The AWS CloudWatch resource is not configured with comprehensive monitoring
        mechanisms, leaving the organization vulnerable to undetected security incidents,
        unauthorized access attempts, and potential data breaches.
      partial: The AWS CloudWatch resource has some monitoring mechanisms in place,
        but additional configurations or enhancements are required to achieve comprehensive
        monitoring for effective detection and response to security incidents and
        unauthorized access attempts.
      success: The AWS CloudWatch resource is configured with comprehensive monitoring
        mechanisms, including alarms, dashboards, and log analysis, enabling effective
        detection and response to security incidents and unauthorized access attempts.
