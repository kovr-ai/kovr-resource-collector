      description: To fully implement secure logging mechanisms for AWS S3 buckets,
        access logging must be enabled for all buckets.
      estimated_time: 10-15 minutes per bucket
      instructions:
      - 1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
      - 2. Select the bucket for which you want to enable access logging.
      - 3. Click on the 'Properties' tab, and then click on the 'Server access logging'
        section.
      - 4. Enable access logging by selecting a target bucket and prefix for the log
        files.
      - 5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all remaining buckets that do not have access logging
        enabled.
    logic: "result = False\n\nif fetched_value is None:\n    result = False\nelse:\n\
      \    for logging_enabled in fetched_value:\n        if logging_enabled:\n  \
      \          result = True\n            break"

    output_statements:
      failure: S3 bucket access logging is not enabled, which violates the secure
        logging mechanisms requirement.
      partial: Some S3 buckets have access logging enabled, while others do not. Secure
        logging mechanisms are partially implemented.
      success: S3 bucket access logging is enabled, ensuring secure logging mechanisms
        are implemented.
