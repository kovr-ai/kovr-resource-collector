      description: To fully implement comprehensive logging mechanisms for the UserResource,
        audit logging must be enabled and configured to capture relevant user account
        activities.
      estimated_time: 30 minutes
      instructions:
      - 1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console and select the appropriate project.
      - 2. Enable the Cloud Audit Logs API for the project.
      - 3. Configure audit logging for the UserResource by selecting the appropriate
        log types and log sinks.
      - 4. Review and customize the log retention policy to ensure logs are retained
        for the desired period.
      - 5. Set up log monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to potential security
        incidents or policy violations.

    output_statements:
      failure: Comprehensive logging mechanisms for the UserResource have not been
        implemented, leaving user account activities unmonitored and increasing the
        risk of security incidents going undetected.
      partial: Comprehensive logging mechanisms for the UserResource have been partially
        implemented, but some critical fields or activities may not be logged, potentially
        leading to gaps in visibility and incident response capabilities.
      success: Comprehensive logging mechanisms for the UserResource have been implemented
        successfully, enabling effective monitoring and incident response.
