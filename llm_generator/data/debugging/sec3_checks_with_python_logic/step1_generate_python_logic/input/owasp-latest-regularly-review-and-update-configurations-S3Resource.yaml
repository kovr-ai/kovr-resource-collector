  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    is designed to ensure that system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated
    to maintain a secure posture. As systems evolve and new vulnerabilities are discovered,
    it is crucial to keep configurations up-to-date to mitigate potential risks. Outdated
    configurations can introduce security vulnerabilities, expose sensitive data,
    or enable unauthorized access. Regular reviews and updates help identify and address
    misconfigurations, apply security patches, and align with the latest security
    best practices.

    literature: The AWS S3 resource is applicable for implementing the OWASP check
      'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'. S3 bucket configurations,
      such as encryption settings, public access controls, and versioning status,
      should be regularly reviewed and updated to maintain a secure posture. Outdated
      or misconfigured S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access,
      or non-compliance with security standards.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The AWS S3 resource provides configurations that should be regularly reviewed
      and updated to maintain a secure posture, aligning with the OWASP check's objective.
