  literature: Comprehensive monitoring mechanisms are essential for detecting and
    responding to security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and potential
    data breaches. This check validates that an organization has implemented robust
    monitoring systems that can track and log various activities across its infrastructure,
    applications, and user interactions. Effective monitoring enables organizations
    to identify anomalies, suspicious behavior, and potential threats in a timely
    manner, allowing for prompt investigation and mitigation. Without comprehensive
    monitoring, organizations may remain unaware of security incidents, leaving them
    vulnerable to data breaches, system compromises, and regulatory non-compliance.

    literature: The AWS CloudWatch service provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities
      for AWS resources and applications. It allows you to collect and track metrics,
      log data, and set alarms to detect anomalies or specific conditions. By configuring
      CloudWatch Alarms, you can monitor various aspects of your AWS environment and
      receive notifications or trigger automated actions when predefined thresholds
      are breached. Additionally, CloudWatch Logs can be used to centralize and analyze
      log data from various sources, enabling you to identify potential security incidents
      or unauthorized access attempts.
    name: CloudWatchResource
    reason: The AWS CloudWatch service provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities
      that align with the security check's requirement for implementing robust monitoring
      mechanisms. By configuring CloudWatch Alarms and analyzing CloudWatch Logs,
      organizations can detect and respond to security incidents, unauthorized access
      attempts, and potential data breaches across their AWS infrastructure and applications.
