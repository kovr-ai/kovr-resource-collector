  literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check validates that applications
    and systems are configured with secure default settings and configurations. Many
    software products and services come with default configurations that prioritize
    ease of use and functionality over security. These default settings often have
    known vulnerabilities, weak security controls, or unnecessary services enabled,
    which can expose the system to various security risks. By enforcing secure defaults,
    this check helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    other security incidents caused by insecure configurations.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check is applicable to AWS
      S3 buckets as they have various configuration options that can impact their
      security posture. By default, S3 buckets are created with public access enabled,
      which can expose sensitive data to unauthorized parties. This check ensures
      that S3 buckets are configured with secure defaults, such as encryption, access
      control, and logging, to mitigate the risk of data breaches and unauthorized
      access.

    reason: AWS S3 buckets have various configuration options that can impact their
      security posture, making them applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults'
      check. By ensuring that S3 buckets are configured with secure defaults, such
      as encryption, access control, and logging, this check helps mitigate the risk
      of data breaches and unauthorized access.
