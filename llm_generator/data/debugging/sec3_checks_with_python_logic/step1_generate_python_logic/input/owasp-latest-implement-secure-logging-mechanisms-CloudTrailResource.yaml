  literature: Secure logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining an audit trail,
    detecting security incidents, and troubleshooting issues in applications and systems.
    Proper logging practices involve capturing relevant information about user activities,
    system events, and security-related occurrences, while ensuring the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of log data. Implementing secure logging mechanisms
    helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements, forensic investigations,
    and incident response efforts. Failure to implement secure logging can lead to
    data breaches, unauthorized access, and an inability to reconstruct events or
    identify the root cause of security incidents.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables secure logging of account
      activity related to actions across the AWS infrastructure. It records API calls
      for AWS services and captures relevant details about each activity, including
      the identity of the API caller, the time of the event, the source IP address,
      and more. CloudTrail logs can be delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket for long-term
      durability and analysis. Implementing CloudTrail with appropriate configurations
      helps meet the secure logging requirements outlined in the OWASP security check.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: AWS CloudTrail provides comprehensive logging capabilities for capturing
      and storing account activity logs, which aligns with the secure logging requirements
      outlined in the OWASP security check. The relevant field paths allow configuring
      CloudTrail to capture desired event types, enable log file validation, encrypt
      logs with KMS, and deliver logs to a secure S3 bucket.
