  literature: 'Establishing disaster recovery plans is a critical aspect of ensuring
    business continuity and minimizing the impact of disruptive events such as natural
    disasters, cyber attacks, or system failures. Disaster recovery plans outline
    the strategies, procedures, and resources needed to restore critical operations,
    data, and systems in the event of a disaster. This check validates the existence
    and adequacy of disaster recovery plans within an organization.


    Having a well-defined and regularly tested disaster recovery plan is essential
    for several reasons:


    1. Data and system protection: Disasters can lead to data loss, system downtime,
    and disruption of critical operations. A comprehensive disaster recovery plan
    helps protect valuable data and ensures that systems can be restored quickly,
    minimizing data loss and operational disruptions.


    2. Business continuity: Disasters can severely impact an organization''s ability
    to conduct business operations. A robust disaster recovery plan enables organizations
    to maintain essential functions, minimize financial losses, and preserve their
    reputation during and after a disruptive event.


    3. Regulatory compliance: Many industries and regulatory bodies require organizations
    to have disaster recovery plans in place to ensure the protection of sensitive
    data and the continuity of critical services.


    4. Risk mitigation: By identifying potential risks and developing strategies to
    address them, disaster recovery plans help organizations mitigate the impact of
    disruptive events and reduce the overall risk exposure.


    Failure to establish and maintain adequate disaster recovery plans can result
    in prolonged system downtime, data loss, financial losses, reputational damage,
    and potential regulatory penalties.'

    literature: AWS S3 buckets are a critical resource for storing data, and ensuring
      their resilience and availability is essential for maintaining business continuity
      in the event of a disaster. Establishing disaster recovery plans for S3 buckets
      involves implementing measures such as cross-region replication, versioning,
      and backup strategies to protect data integrity and enable rapid recovery in
      case of data loss or system failures.

    reason: AWS S3 buckets are a critical storage resource, and establishing disaster
      recovery plans for these buckets is essential for ensuring data protection,
      business continuity, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
