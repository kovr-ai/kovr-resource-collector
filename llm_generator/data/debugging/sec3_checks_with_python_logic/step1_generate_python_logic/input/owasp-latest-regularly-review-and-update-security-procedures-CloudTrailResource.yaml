  literature: The OWASP recommendation to regularly review and update security procedures
    is a crucial practice for maintaining an effective and up-to-date security posture.
    Security threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices are constantly evolving,
    and organizations must adapt their security procedures accordingly. Regular reviews
    and updates ensure that security measures remain relevant and effective against
    emerging threats, and that they align with the latest industry standards and regulatory
    requirements. Failure to regularly review and update security procedures can leave
    organizations vulnerable to new attack vectors, compliance violations, and potential
    data breaches.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events, providing a comprehensive audit trail of account activity. By enabling
      CloudTrail and configuring it to capture relevant events, organizations can

      detect unauthorized access attempts, and monitor compliance with security policies
      and procedures. Regular review of CloudTrail logs is a crucial step in maintaining
      an effective security posture and identifying areas for improvement or updates
      to security procedures.
