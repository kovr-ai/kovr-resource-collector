  - ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. Access controls are essential security mechanisms that ensure
    only authorized users or entities can access and perform specific actions on protected
    resources or data. Failing to implement proper access controls on the server-side
    can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security vulnerabilities.
    This check helps identify and mitigate risks associated with improper access control
    implementation, such as broken authentication, broken access control, and insecure
    direct object references.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
      is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the
      server-side of an application. In the context of AWS IAM resources, this check
      can be implemented by analyzing the IAM policies and their statements to ensure
      that access controls are properly defined and enforced. The IAM policies define
      the permissions granted to users, groups, and roles, and their statements specify
      the actions, resources, and conditions under which those permissions are granted.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource is valid for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side'
      check because it provides access to the IAM policies and their statements, which
      define the access controls for users, groups, and roles. Additionally, the resource
      includes information about user access keys and multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) devices, which are relevant for validating access controls.
