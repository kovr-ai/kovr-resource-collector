  literature: Comprehensive monitoring mechanisms are essential for detecting and
    responding to security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and potential
    data breaches. This check validates that an organization has implemented robust
    monitoring systems that can track and log various activities across its infrastructure,
    applications, and user interactions. Effective monitoring enables organizations
    to identify anomalies, suspicious behavior, and potential threats in a timely
    manner, allowing for prompt investigation and mitigation. Without comprehensive
    monitoring, organizations may remain unaware of security incidents, leaving them
    vulnerable to data breaches, system compromises, and regulatory non-compliance.

    literature: The AWS S3 resource can be used to implement comprehensive monitoring
      mechanisms for detecting and responding to security incidents, unauthorized
      access attempts, and potential data breaches. By enabling logging and monitoring
      for S3 buckets, organizations can track and log various activities related to
      object access, bucket configuration changes, and other events. This allows for
      the identification of anomalies, suspicious behavior, and potential threats
      in a timely manner, enabling prompt investigation and mitigation.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The AWS S3 resource provides various fields and configurations that can
      be used to implement comprehensive monitoring mechanisms. By enabling logging,
      configuring public access blocks, and ensuring proper encryption, organizations
      can monitor and log activities related to S3 buckets, detect potential security
      incidents, and respond accordingly.
