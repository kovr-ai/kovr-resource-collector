  literature: Security awareness training is crucial for organizations to educate
    their employees on identifying and mitigating potential security threats. It helps
    employees understand the importance of cybersecurity, recognize common attack
    vectors, and learn best practices for protecting sensitive information and systems.
    Regular security awareness training can significantly reduce the risk of human
    error, which is often a leading cause of data breaches and cyber incidents. By
    providing employees with the knowledge and skills to identify and respond to security
    threats, organizations can strengthen their overall security posture and better
    protect their assets and reputation.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement security awareness
      training for employees. The 'users' field path contains information about IAM
      users, including their access keys, MFA devices, and associated policies. By
      analyzing the policies attached to each user, you can identify if there are
      any policies related to security awareness training, such as mandatory training
      requirements or access restrictions based on training completion. Additionally,
      you can use the access key information to monitor user activity and ensure that
      only authorized users with proper training have access to sensitive resources.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides information about IAM users, their access keys,
      MFA devices, and associated policies, which can be used to implement and enforce
      security awareness training requirements.
