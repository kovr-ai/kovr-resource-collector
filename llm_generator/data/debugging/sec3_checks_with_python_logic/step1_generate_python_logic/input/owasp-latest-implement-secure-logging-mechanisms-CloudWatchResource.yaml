  literature: Secure logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining an audit trail,
    detecting security incidents, and troubleshooting issues in applications and systems.
    Proper logging practices involve capturing relevant information about user activities,
    system events, and security-related occurrences, while ensuring the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of log data. Implementing secure logging mechanisms
    helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements, forensic investigations,
    and incident response efforts. Failure to implement secure logging can lead to
    data breaches, unauthorized access, and an inability to reconstruct events or
    identify the root cause of security incidents.

    literature: AWS CloudWatch provides logging and monitoring capabilities that can
      be leveraged to implement secure logging mechanisms. CloudWatch Log Groups can
      be used to collect and store log data from various AWS services and applications.
      Log data can be encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys to ensure
      confidentiality. CloudWatch also supports log retention policies to maintain
      an audit trail for a specified duration. Additionally, CloudWatch Metric Filters
      can be used to analyze log data and trigger alarms or actions based on specific
      patterns or conditions, enabling proactive monitoring and incident response.
