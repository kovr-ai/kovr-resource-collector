  literature: Secure software supply chain practices are essential for ensuring the
    integrity and security of software throughout its entire lifecycle, from development
    to deployment. This check validates that organizations have implemented robust
    processes and controls to protect their software supply chain from potential threats
    and vulnerabilities. A compromised software supply chain can lead to the introduction
    of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities, which can have severe consequences
    for the organization's systems and data. By implementing secure software supply
    chain practices, organizations can mitigate risks such as software tampering,
    unauthorized access, and supply chain attacks.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events, providing a comprehensive audit trail of activities across your AWS
      account. By configuring CloudTrail to log relevant events and storing the logs
      in a secure and immutable location, organizations can implement secure software
      supply chain practices by monitoring and auditing activities related to their
      software deployments and infrastructure changes. This allows for the detection
      of unauthorized or malicious actions, enabling organizations to respond promptly
      and mitigate potential threats to their software supply chain.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: AWS CloudTrail provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
      that can be leveraged to implement secure software supply chain practices. By
      configuring CloudTrail to log relevant events, organizations can audit and monitor
      activities related to their software deployments, infrastructure changes, and
      other critical operations, enabling them to detect and respond to potential
      threats or unauthorized actions.
