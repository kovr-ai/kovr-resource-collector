  literature: User input validation and sanitization is a critical security measure
    that helps prevent various types of attacks, such as injection attacks (e.g.,
    SQL injection, command injection, code injection), cross-site scripting (XSS),
    and other types of input-related vulnerabilities. Failing to properly validate
    and sanitize user input can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system
    compromise. This check ensures that all user input is thoroughly validated and
    sanitized before being processed or stored, reducing the risk of injection attacks
    and other input-related vulnerabilities.

    literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud contains various fields related to
      user information, including contact details, profile information, and security
      settings. To implement the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
      security check, it is crucial to validate and sanitize any user-provided data
      before storing or processing it. This includes fields such as contact_info.emails[].address,
      contact_info.phones[].value, and profile_info.languages[].languageCode, where
      users may input custom values.
    name: UserResource
    reason: The UserResource contains fields that accept user input, which must be
      validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and other input-related
      vulnerabilities.
