  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'
    aims to ensure that applications and systems do not expose unnecessary features,
    components, or functionality that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
    Unnecessary features and components can introduce security vulnerabilities, increase
    the attack surface, and provide entry points for malicious actors. By removing
    or disabling these unnecessary elements, the overall security posture of the application
    or system is improved, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches,
    or other security incidents.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the OWASP
      check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'. CloudTrail
      is a service that records AWS API calls and related events, providing a log
      of activities across your AWS infrastructure. By configuring CloudTrail appropriately,
      you can ensure that only necessary events and resources are logged, reducing
      the attack surface and minimizing the exposure of sensitive data or unnecessary
      components.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource allows you to configure event selectors and data
      resources to control which events and resources are logged. By carefully configuring
      these settings, you can ensure that only necessary events and resources are
      captured, reducing the attack surface and minimizing the exposure of unnecessary
      components or features.
