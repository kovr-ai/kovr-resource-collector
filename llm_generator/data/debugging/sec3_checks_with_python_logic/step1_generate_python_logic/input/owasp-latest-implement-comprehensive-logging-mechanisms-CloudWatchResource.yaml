  literature: Comprehensive logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining visibility
    into system activities, detecting potential security incidents, and enabling effective
    incident response and forensic analysis. Logging captures detailed information
    about user actions, system events, and security-related activities, providing
    a trail of evidence that can be used to investigate and respond to security breaches,
    policy violations, or operational issues. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
    helps organizations meet compliance requirements, identify and mitigate risks,
    and maintain accountability. Without proper logging, it becomes challenging to
    detect and respond to security incidents, leaving systems vulnerable to various
    threats.

    literature: AWS CloudWatch provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
      that can be leveraged to implement comprehensive logging mechanisms as recommended
      by OWASP. CloudWatch allows you to collect and monitor logs from various AWS
      resources and services, including EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and other
      AWS services. You can create log groups and log streams to centralize and organize
      your logs, and then use CloudWatch Logs Insights to search, analyze, and visualize
      log data. Additionally, CloudWatch Alarms can be configured to monitor specific
      metrics and trigger actions, such as sending notifications or executing automated
      remediation workflows, based on predefined thresholds.
