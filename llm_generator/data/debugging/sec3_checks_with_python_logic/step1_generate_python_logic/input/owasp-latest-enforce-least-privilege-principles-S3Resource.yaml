  literature: The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security concept that
    restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only those permissions
    required to perform authorized tasks. By enforcing least privilege, organizations
    can reduce their attack surface, limit potential damage from malicious actors,
    and mitigate the risks associated with excessive permissions. This check validates
    that systems and applications adhere to the least privilege principle, ensuring
    that users, processes, and services operate with the minimum necessary privileges
    to accomplish their intended functions, and no more. Implementing least privilege
    is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture and protecting sensitive
    data and systems from unauthorized access or misuse.

    literature: The AWS S3 resource is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privilege-principles'
      security check. S3 buckets can be configured with various access controls and
      permissions to enforce the principle of least privilege. By properly configuring
      bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), and other security settings, you
      can restrict access to only authorized users, roles, or services, and limit
      the actions they can perform on the bucket and its objects.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3 resource provides various configuration options and settings that
      allow you to implement the principle of least privilege by controlling access
      to buckets and objects, enabling encryption, and restricting public access.
      The relevant field paths cover these security controls.
