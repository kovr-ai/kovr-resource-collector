  literature: Secure configuration management processes are essential for maintaining
    the integrity and security of systems and applications. This check validates that
    organizations have implemented robust processes for managing configuration changes,
    including tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes in a controlled
    manner. Failure to implement secure configuration management processes can lead
    to unauthorized or unintended changes, which can introduce vulnerabilities, system
    instability, and compliance issues. Secure configuration management processes
    help ensure that changes are properly reviewed, tested, and approved before deployment,
    reducing the risk of security incidents and system outages.

    literature: The AWS IAM resource is applicable for implementing secure configuration
      management processes. IAM policies define permissions for AWS resources and
      services, and managing these policies through a secure change control process
      is crucial for maintaining system integrity and security. By reviewing IAM policy
      configurations, changes, and access, organizations can ensure that only authorized
      and intended modifications are made, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities
      or granting excessive permissions.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource provides visibility into IAM policies, user access keys,
      and MFA device configurations, which are essential components of secure configuration
      management processes. By monitoring and controlling changes to these elements,
      organizations can maintain the integrity of their AWS environment and ensure
      compliance with security best practices.
