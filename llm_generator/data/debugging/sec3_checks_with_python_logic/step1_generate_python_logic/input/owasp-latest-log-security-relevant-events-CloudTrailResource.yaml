  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. Logging security-relevant events helps detect and investigate
    potential security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and other malicious
    activities. It provides a record of system activities, user actions, and security-related
    incidents, enabling organizations to monitor and analyze system behavior, identify
    potential threats, and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is directly applicable for implementing
      the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' security check. CloudTrail is
      a service that records AWS API calls and related events, providing a comprehensive
      audit trail of activities across your AWS account. By configuring CloudTrail
      to log security-relevant events, you can meet the requirements of this check
      and maintain a detailed record of security-related activities for incident response,
      forensic analysis, and compliance purposes.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource allows you to configure event selectors and data
      resources to capture specific security-relevant events, including management
      events and read/write operations. Additionally, you can enable log file validation
      to ensure the integrity of the logs. These features directly align with the
      requirements of the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check, making
      CloudTrail a valid resource for implementing this security control.
