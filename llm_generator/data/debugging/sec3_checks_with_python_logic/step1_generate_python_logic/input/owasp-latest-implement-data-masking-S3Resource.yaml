  literature: Data masking, also known as data obfuscation or data de-identification,
    is the process of hiding or obscuring sensitive data by replacing it with fictitious
    but realistic values. This technique is crucial for protecting sensitive information,
    such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or intellectual
    property, from unauthorized access or misuse. By implementing data masking, organizations
    can comply with data privacy regulations, mitigate the risk of data breaches,
    and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data during development,
    testing, or other non-production environments. Failure to properly mask sensitive
    data can lead to data leaks, identity theft, financial fraud, and regulatory fines.

    literature: The AWS S3 service provides data encryption capabilities that can
      be used to implement data masking and protect sensitive information stored in
      S3 buckets. By enabling server-side encryption (SSE) with either AWS-managed
      keys (SSE-S3) or customer-managed keys (SSE-KMS), S3 automatically encrypts
      data at rest, effectively masking the original data. Additionally, S3 bucket
      policies and access controls can be configured to restrict access to authorized
      users/roles, further enhancing data protection.
