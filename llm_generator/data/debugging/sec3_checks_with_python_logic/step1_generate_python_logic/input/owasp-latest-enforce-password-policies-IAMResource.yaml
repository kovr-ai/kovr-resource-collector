  literature: Password policies are a set of rules and requirements that govern the
    creation, usage, and management of passwords within an organization or system.
    These policies aim to enhance the security of authentication mechanisms by enforcing
    strong password practices, reducing the risk of password guessing or cracking
    attacks, and mitigating the potential impact of compromised credentials. Implementing
    robust password policies is crucial for protecting sensitive information, maintaining
    system integrity, and preventing unauthorized access. This security check validates
    the existence and enforcement of strong password policies, which typically include
    requirements such as minimum password length, complexity rules, password expiration
    periods, and restrictions on password reuse.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing the owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies
      security check. This resource contains information about IAM users and their
      associated password policies. By analyzing the policies attached to IAM users
      and the policy statements within those policies, it is possible to validate
      if strong password requirements are enforced.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM user details, including their access
      keys and associated policies. By inspecting the policy statements and conditions,
      it is possible to determine if password complexity, expiration, and reuse requirements
      are enforced.
