  literature: The OWASP recommendation to regularly review and update security procedures
    is a crucial practice for maintaining an effective and up-to-date security posture.
    Security threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices are constantly evolving,
    and organizations must adapt their security procedures accordingly. Regular reviews
    and updates ensure that security measures remain relevant and effective against
    emerging threats, and that they align with the latest industry standards and regulatory
    requirements. Failure to regularly review and update security procedures can leave
    organizations vulnerable to new attack vectors, compliance violations, and potential
    data breaches.

    literature: The IAM resource in AWS is applicable for implementing the OWASP recommendation
      to regularly review and update security procedures. IAM policies define permissions
      and access controls for AWS resources, and they should be regularly reviewed
      and updated to ensure that they align with the organization's security requirements
      and best practices. Outdated or overly permissive policies can introduce security
      risks and potential data breaches.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource in AWS contains policies that define permissions and
      access controls for AWS resources. Regularly reviewing and updating these policies
      is crucial for maintaining an effective security posture and aligning with the
      latest security best practices and regulatory requirements.
