  literature: Proper access control mechanisms are essential for ensuring that only
    authorized users or entities can access and perform operations on sensitive data,
    resources, or functionalities within an application or system. Implementing robust
    access control measures helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    potential misuse or abuse of privileged operations. This check validates that
    the application or system has implemented appropriate access control mechanisms,
    such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC),
    or other industry-standard access control models. Failure to implement proper
    access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential
    security breaches.

    literature: The AWS IAM resource is a critical component for implementing proper
      access control mechanisms in the AWS cloud environment. IAM allows you to create
      users, groups, and roles, and assign them specific permissions through IAM policies.
      These policies define what actions are allowed or denied for which AWS resources.
      By carefully crafting IAM policies and assigning them to the appropriate users,
      groups, or roles, you can enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure
      that only authorized entities can access and perform operations on sensitive
      resources.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource provides the necessary components to implement and manage
      access control mechanisms in AWS. The policies field contains the IAM policies
      that define permissions, and the users field contains information about IAM
      users and their access keys and MFA devices, which are crucial for authentication
      and authorization.
