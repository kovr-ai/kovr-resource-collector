  literature: The 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations' check is designed
    to ensure that organizations comply with relevant data protection regulations
    and industry standards when handling sensitive information. Data protection regulations,
    such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer
    Privacy Act (CCPA), impose strict requirements on how organizations collect, process,
    store, and transfer personal data. Failure to comply with these regulations can
    result in significant fines and reputational damage. This check helps organizations
    identify potential areas of non-compliance and take appropriate measures to protect
    sensitive data and maintain regulatory compliance.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is relevant for implementing the 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations'
      security check. IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies define permissions
      for accessing AWS resources, including sensitive data. By analyzing IAM policies,
      you can identify potential areas of non-compliance with data protection regulations,
      such as overly permissive access to personal data or lack of proper access controls.
      Ensuring that IAM policies adhere to data protection regulations is crucial
      for maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive information.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM policies and user access keys,
      which are essential for evaluating compliance with data protection regulations.
      By analyzing the policy statements, actions, and resources, you can identify
      potential areas of non-compliance, such as overly permissive access to sensitive
      data or lack of proper access controls. Additionally, reviewing user access
      keys can help identify potential security risks and ensure that access to sensitive
      data is properly managed.
