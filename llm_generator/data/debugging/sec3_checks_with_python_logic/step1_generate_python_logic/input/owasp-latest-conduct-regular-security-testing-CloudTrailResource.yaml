  literature: Regular security testing is a crucial practice in cybersecurity to identify
    vulnerabilities, assess the effectiveness of security controls, and ensure the
    overall security posture of an organization. This check validates whether an organization
    conducts regular security testing, such as penetration testing, vulnerability
    assessments, and code reviews, to proactively identify and mitigate potential
    security risks. Failure to perform regular security testing can leave an organization
    vulnerable to cyber threats, data breaches, and compliance violations.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events for your account. It provides a log of activities that can be used for
      security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. By enabling
      CloudTrail and configuring it to capture relevant events, organizations can
      conduct regular security testing and assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities
      and ensure compliance with security standards.
