  literature: The OWASP latest secure authentication mechanisms check validates that
    the application implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect against
    common authentication attacks such as brute-force, credential stuffing, and session
    hijacking. Proper authentication is crucial for ensuring that only authorized
    users can access sensitive data and functionality within the application. Implementing
    secure authentication mechanisms helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access,
    data breaches, and other security incidents.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing secure authentication
      mechanisms as per the OWASP latest guidelines. IAM (Identity and Access Management)
      is the core authentication and authorization service in AWS that allows you
      to manage users, groups, roles, and their associated permissions. By properly
      configuring IAM policies, you can enforce secure authentication practices such
      as multi-factor authentication (MFA), password policies, and access controls.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides the necessary configuration options and settings
      to implement secure authentication mechanisms as recommended by OWASP. It allows
      you to enforce MFA, manage user credentials, and define granular access policies.
