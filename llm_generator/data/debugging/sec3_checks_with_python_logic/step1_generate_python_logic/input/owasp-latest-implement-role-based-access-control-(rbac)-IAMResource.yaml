  literature: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security principle that restricts
    system access to authorized users based on their assigned roles and permissions.
    It is a fundamental security measure that helps prevent unauthorized access, data
    breaches, and misuse of system resources. By implementing RBAC, organizations
    can ensure that users only have access to the information and functionality they
    need to perform their job duties, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    This check validates that the application or system has implemented RBAC effectively,
    reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security incidents.

    literature: The AWS IAM Resource is a critical component for implementing Role-Based
      Access Control (RBAC) in AWS. IAM allows you to create users, groups, and roles
      with specific permissions to access AWS resources. By defining policies and
      attaching them to IAM entities, you can enforce least privilege access and ensure
      that users only have the necessary permissions to perform their job functions.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM Resource provides the necessary components to implement RBAC,
      including policies, user identities, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices.
      By analyzing the policy statements, user ARNs, and MFA devices, you can validate
      if RBAC is properly configured and enforced.
