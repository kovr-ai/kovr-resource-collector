  literature: Establishing incident response plans is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity
    preparedness. It involves creating a comprehensive set of procedures and protocols
    to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents or data
    breaches. An incident response plan outlines the roles, responsibilities, and
    actions to be taken by the organization in the event of a security incident, ensuring
    a coordinated and efficient response. This check validates the existence and adequacy
    of such plans, which are essential for minimizing the impact of security incidents,
    protecting sensitive data, maintaining business continuity, and complying with
    regulatory requirements. By having well-defined incident response plans in place,
    organizations can respond swiftly and effectively to security incidents, mitigate
    potential damages, and enhance their overall cybersecurity posture.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events, providing a comprehensive audit trail of activities across your AWS
      account. By configuring CloudTrail appropriately, you can capture and analyze
      logs to detect and respond to security incidents effectively. This resource
      is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-establish-incident-response-plans'
      security check as it allows you to set up logging and monitoring mechanisms,
      which are crucial components of an incident response plan.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource allows you to configure and manage trails, which
      capture API activity logs across your AWS account. By enabling appropriate event
      selectors, data resource types, and management event logging, you can ensure
      comprehensive logging of relevant activities. Additionally, enabling log file
      validation, multi-region trails, and configuring an S3 bucket for log storage
      are essential for maintaining an audit trail and supporting incident response
      efforts.
