  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'
    aims to ensure that applications and systems do not expose unnecessary features,
    components, or functionality that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
    Unnecessary features and components can introduce security vulnerabilities, increase
    the attack surface, and provide entry points for malicious actors. By removing
    or disabling these unnecessary elements, the overall security posture of the application
    or system is improved, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches,
    or other security incidents.
