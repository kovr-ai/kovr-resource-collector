  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' check validates
    that an organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
    and infrastructure components. This includes ensuring that proper security controls
    are in place throughout the deployment lifecycle, such as code reviews, vulnerability
    scanning, secure configuration management, and access controls. Implementing secure
    deployment processes is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability of systems and data, as well as reducing the risk of successful
    cyber attacks.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is relevant for implementing secure deployment
      processes as it provides an audit trail of AWS API calls and related events.
      By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it properly, organizations can monitor
      and review activities across their AWS infrastructure, including deployments
      and changes made to resources. This visibility into deployment processes helps
      ensure proper security controls are applied and allows for investigation of
      potential security incidents.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: CloudTrail provides an audit trail of AWS API calls and related events,
      which is essential for monitoring and reviewing deployment activities across
      the AWS infrastructure. By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it properly,
      organizations can ensure secure deployment processes are followed and investigate
      any potential security incidents.
