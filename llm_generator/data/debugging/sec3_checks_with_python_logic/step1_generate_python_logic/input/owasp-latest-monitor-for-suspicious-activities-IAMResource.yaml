  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to detect and alert on any suspicious or anomalous activities within an organization's
    systems and applications. It continuously monitors user behavior, system logs,
    network traffic, and other relevant data sources to identify potential security
    threats or unauthorized actions. This check is crucial because it helps organizations
    proactively identify and respond to potential security incidents, such as unauthorized
    access attempts, data exfiltration, or malicious insider activities. By monitoring
    for suspicious activities, organizations can take timely action to mitigate risks,
    investigate incidents, and prevent further damage or data breaches.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
      security check. By analyzing the IAM policies, user access keys, and MFA device
      information, you can monitor for suspicious activities such as unauthorized
      access attempts, privilege escalation, or misuse of credentials. The policies
      field can be inspected for overly permissive statements, while the user access
      keys and MFA devices can be checked for unusual activity patterns or disabled
      MFA.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource contains relevant information about IAM policies, user
      access keys, and MFA devices, which can be used to detect suspicious activities
      related to authentication, authorization, and access control.
