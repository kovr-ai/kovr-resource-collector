  literature: Secure logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining an audit trail,
    detecting security incidents, and troubleshooting issues in applications and systems.
    Proper logging practices involve capturing relevant information about user activities,
    system events, and security-related occurrences, while ensuring the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of log data. Implementing secure logging mechanisms
    helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements, forensic investigations,
    and incident response efforts. Failure to implement secure logging can lead to
    data breaches, unauthorized access, and an inability to reconstruct events or
    identify the root cause of security incidents.

    literature: The AWS S3 resource can be used to implement secure logging mechanisms
      by enabling access logging and server access logging for S3 buckets. Access
      logs provide detailed records of requests made to a bucket, including the requester,
      bucket name, request time, action, response status, and error codes. Server
      access logs provide detailed records about requests that were made to a bucket
      and the response from the server. These logs can be used for security monitoring,
      operational troubleshooting, and compliance purposes.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3 resource provides the necessary configuration options to enable
      access logging and server access logging for S3 buckets, which is a key aspect
      of implementing secure logging mechanisms.
