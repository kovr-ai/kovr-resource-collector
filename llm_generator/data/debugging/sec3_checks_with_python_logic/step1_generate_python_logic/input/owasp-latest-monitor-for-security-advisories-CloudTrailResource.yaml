  literature: Security advisories are notifications issued by software vendors, security
    researchers, or other organizations to inform users about vulnerabilities, security
    flaws, or other security-related issues in their products or services. Monitoring
    for security advisories is crucial because it allows organizations to stay informed
    about potential threats and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks. Failing
    to monitor for security advisories can leave systems and applications vulnerable
    to known attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromises, or
    other security incidents.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events for your account. It provides a log of activities that can be used to
      monitor for security advisories and potential threats. By configuring CloudTrail
      to log relevant events and integrating it with security monitoring tools, organizations
      can stay informed about security advisories and take appropriate actions to
      mitigate risks.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: AWS CloudTrail can be configured to log API calls and events related to
      various AWS services, including those that may be affected by security advisories.
      By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it to capture relevant events, organizations
      can monitor for potential security issues and take appropriate actions.
