  literature: Centralized log management is a critical security practice that involves
    collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from various sources (e.g., servers,
    applications, network devices) in a centralized location. This enables organizations
    to monitor and detect security incidents, troubleshoot issues, and comply with
    regulatory requirements. Without centralized log management, it becomes challenging
    to gain visibility into system activities, identify potential threats, and respond
    to incidents effectively. Implementing centralized log management enhances an
    organization's security posture by providing a comprehensive view of system events,
    enabling timely detection of anomalies, and facilitating incident response and
    forensic investigations.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables centralized log management
      by recording AWS API calls and related events across multiple AWS services and
      regions. It provides a comprehensive audit trail of account activity, which
      can be analyzed to detect potential security incidents, troubleshoot operational
      issues, and comply with regulatory requirements. CloudTrail logs can be delivered
      to an Amazon S3 bucket for long-term storage and analysis.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: AWS CloudTrail is a service specifically designed for centralized log
      management, capturing API activity across multiple AWS services and regions.
      By configuring CloudTrail trails and event selectors, organizations can collect
      and store logs in a centralized S3 bucket for analysis and auditing purposes.
