  literature: Centralized log management is a critical security practice that involves
    collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from various sources (e.g., servers,
    applications, network devices) in a centralized location. This enables organizations
    to monitor and detect security incidents, troubleshoot issues, and comply with
    regulatory requirements. Without centralized log management, it becomes challenging
    to gain visibility into system activities, identify potential threats, and respond
    to incidents effectively. Implementing centralized log management enhances an
    organization's security posture by providing a comprehensive view of system events,
    enabling timely detection of anomalies, and facilitating incident response and
    forensic investigations.

    literature: AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects
      and manages log data from various AWS resources and applications. It provides
      centralized log management capabilities, allowing you to store, monitor, and
      analyze log data from multiple sources in a unified location. CloudWatch integrates
      with other AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS, to
      collect and process log data. By implementing centralized log management with
      CloudWatch, you can gain visibility into system activities, detect security
      incidents, troubleshoot issues, and comply with regulatory requirements.

      The 'log_groups' field paths are relevant for implementing this security check,
      as they provide information about the log groups, their configurations, and
      log data storage.
