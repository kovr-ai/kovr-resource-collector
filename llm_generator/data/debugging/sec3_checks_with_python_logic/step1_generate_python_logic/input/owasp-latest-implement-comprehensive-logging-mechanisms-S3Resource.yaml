  literature: Comprehensive logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining visibility
    into system activities, detecting potential security incidents, and enabling effective
    incident response and forensic analysis. Logging captures detailed information
    about user actions, system events, and security-related activities, providing
    a trail of evidence that can be used to investigate and respond to security breaches,
    policy violations, or operational issues. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
    helps organizations meet compliance requirements, identify and mitigate risks,
    and maintain accountability. Without proper logging, it becomes challenging to
    detect and respond to security incidents, leaving systems vulnerable to various
    threats.

    literature: AWS S3 buckets support comprehensive logging mechanisms that capture
      detailed information about access requests, object-level operations, and other
      bucket-related activities. By enabling S3 server access logging, organizations
      can maintain visibility into all requests made to their S3 buckets, including
      the requester, bucket name, request time, action, response status, and other
      relevant details. This logging data can be used for security monitoring, incident
      response, and forensic analysis, helping organizations meet compliance requirements
      and maintain accountability.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The AWS S3 resource is valid for implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
      as it provides the necessary configuration options to enable and manage access
      logging for S3 buckets.
