  literature: The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security concept that
    restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only those permissions
    required to perform authorized tasks. By enforcing least privilege, organizations
    can reduce their attack surface, limit potential damage from malicious actors,
    and mitigate the risks associated with excessive permissions. This check validates
    that systems and applications adhere to the least privilege principle, ensuring
    that users, processes, and services operate with the minimum necessary privileges
    to accomplish their intended functions, and no more. Implementing least privilege
    is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture and protecting sensitive
    data and systems from unauthorized access or misuse.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privilege-principles'
      security check. CloudTrail logs all API calls made within an AWS account, allowing
      you to monitor and analyze user and service activity. By configuring CloudTrail
      trails with appropriate event selectors and data resource filters, you can enforce
      least privilege principles by logging and auditing access to specific AWS resources
      and services. This enables you to identify and remediate any excessive permissions
      or unauthorized access attempts.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: CloudTrail allows you to log and monitor access to specific AWS resources
      and services, which is essential for enforcing least privilege principles. By
      configuring event selectors and data resource filters, you can ensure that only
      necessary access is granted and logged.
