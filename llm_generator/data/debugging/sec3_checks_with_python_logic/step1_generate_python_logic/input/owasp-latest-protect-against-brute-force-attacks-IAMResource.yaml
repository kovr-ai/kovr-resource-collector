  literature: Brute force attacks are a common technique used by attackers to gain
    unauthorized access to systems or accounts by systematically trying all possible
    combinations of credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) until the correct
    one is found. This check validates that appropriate measures are in place to protect
    against such attacks, which can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and
    other security incidents. Implementing protection mechanisms like account lockouts,
    IP address blocking, and CAPTCHA challenges can significantly reduce the risk
    of successful brute force attacks.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement protection against
      brute force attacks on IAM user accounts. By configuring appropriate password
      policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, and access key rotation
      policies, you can significantly reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks
      on IAM user credentials.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM user accounts, access keys, and
      password/MFA policies, which are essential for implementing brute force attack
      protection mechanisms.
