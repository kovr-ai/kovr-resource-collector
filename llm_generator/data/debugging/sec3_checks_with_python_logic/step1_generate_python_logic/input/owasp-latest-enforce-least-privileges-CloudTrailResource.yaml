  literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check validates that applications
    and systems follow the principle of least privilege, which is a fundamental security
    concept that restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only
    those permissions that are essential for performing their intended functions.
    Granting excessive privileges increases the potential attack surface and risk
    of unauthorized access or misuse. This check helps mitigate threats like privilege
    escalation, unauthorized data access, and malicious code execution by ensuring
    that entities operate with the minimum necessary permissions.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges'
      security check. CloudTrail logs all API activity across AWS accounts and services,
      allowing you to monitor and analyze user and resource activity. By configuring
      CloudTrail trails with appropriate event selectors and data resource filters,
      you can enforce least privilege by auditing and restricting access to only necessary
      resources and actions.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource allows you to configure event selectors and data
      resource filters to log and monitor specific API activities and resource access.
      This enables you to enforce least privilege by auditing and restricting access
      to only necessary resources and actions, aligning with the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges'
      security check.
