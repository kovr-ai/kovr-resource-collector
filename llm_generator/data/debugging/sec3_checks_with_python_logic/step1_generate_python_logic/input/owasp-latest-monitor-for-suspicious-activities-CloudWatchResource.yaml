  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to detect and alert on any suspicious or anomalous activities within an organization's
    systems and applications. It continuously monitors user behavior, system logs,
    network traffic, and other relevant data sources to identify potential security
    threats or unauthorized actions. This check is crucial because it helps organizations
    proactively identify and respond to potential security incidents, such as unauthorized
    access attempts, data exfiltration, or malicious insider activities. By monitoring
    for suspicious activities, organizations can take timely action to mitigate risks,
    investigate incidents, and prevent further damage or data breaches.

    literature: The AWS CloudWatch service can be used to implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
      security check. CloudWatch allows you to collect and monitor various logs, metrics,
      and events from your AWS resources and applications. By creating CloudWatch
      Alarms and configuring appropriate alarm actions, you can detect and alert on
      suspicious or anomalous activities within your AWS environment.
    name: CloudWatchResource
    reason: CloudWatch Alarms can be configured to monitor various metrics and logs
      from AWS services and applications. By setting appropriate alarm thresholds
      and actions, you can detect and alert on suspicious activities, such as unusual
      resource usage patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or security-related events.
      Additionally, CloudWatch Log Groups can be used to collect and analyze log data
      from various sources, enabling you to identify and investigate potential security
      incidents.
