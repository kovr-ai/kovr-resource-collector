  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    is designed to ensure that system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated
    to maintain a secure posture. As systems evolve and new vulnerabilities are discovered,
    it is crucial to keep configurations up-to-date to mitigate potential risks. Outdated
    configurations can introduce security vulnerabilities, expose sensitive data,
    or enable unauthorized access. Regular reviews and updates help identify and address
    misconfigurations, apply security patches, and align with the latest security
    best practices.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the OWASP
      check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'. CloudTrail
      is a service that records AWS API calls and related events, providing a log
      of account activity. By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it correctly, organizations
      can regularly review and audit the logs to identify potential misconfigurations,
      unauthorized access attempts, or other security-related events. This allows
      for timely updates and remediation of any identified issues, aligning with the
      security check's objective of maintaining an up-to-date and secure system configuration.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource provides a centralized logging mechanism for AWS
      account activity, enabling regular reviews and updates to system configurations
      based on the logged events. By configuring CloudTrail appropriately, organizations
      can ensure that relevant API calls and events are captured, allowing for comprehensive
      monitoring and timely remediation of any identified issues.
