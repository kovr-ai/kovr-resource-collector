  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' check validates
    that an organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
    and infrastructure components. This includes ensuring that proper security controls
    are in place throughout the deployment lifecycle, such as code reviews, vulnerability
    scanning, secure configuration management, and access controls. Implementing secure
    deployment processes is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability of systems and data, as well as reducing the risk of successful
    cyber attacks.

    literature: The IAM resource in AWS is relevant for implementing secure deployment
      processes. IAM policies define permissions for resources and actions, which
      can be used to enforce least privilege access and segregation of duties during
      deployments. Additionally, IAM user access keys and MFA devices relate to secure
      authentication and authorization controls for deployment personnel.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource contains critical configuration related to access controls,
      permissions, and authentication factors that directly impact the security of
      deployment processes.
