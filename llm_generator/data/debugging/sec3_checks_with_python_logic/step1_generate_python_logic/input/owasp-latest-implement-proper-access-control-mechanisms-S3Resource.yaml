  literature: Proper access control mechanisms are essential for ensuring that only
    authorized users or entities can access and perform operations on sensitive data,
    resources, or functionalities within an application or system. Implementing robust
    access control measures helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    potential misuse or abuse of privileged operations. This check validates that
    the application or system has implemented appropriate access control mechanisms,
    such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC),
    or other industry-standard access control models. Failure to implement proper
    access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential
    security breaches.

    literature: The AWS S3 service provides various access control mechanisms to ensure
      that only authorized users or entities can access and perform operations on
      S3 buckets and objects. S3 supports resource-based access policies, bucket policies,
      Access Control Lists (ACLs), and integration with AWS Identity and Access Management
      (IAM) for role-based access control. These mechanisms allow you to define granular
      permissions for different actions, resources, and conditions, enabling proper
      access control implementation.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3 resource is valid for implementing proper access control mechanisms
      because it provides various access control features and configurations that
      can be used to restrict unauthorized access to S3 buckets and objects.
