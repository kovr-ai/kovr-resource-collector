  literature: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a process that identifies and
    analyzes the open source and third-party components used in an application. It
    helps organizations understand the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated
    with these components, enabling them to make informed decisions about their use
    and take appropriate mitigation measures. Implementing an SCA process is crucial
    because it helps organizations maintain the security, compliance, and quality
    of their software by identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities, license
    compliance issues, and outdated or unsupported components. By regularly scanning
    their applications for known vulnerabilities and licensing issues, organizations
    can proactively address these risks and reduce the likelihood of security breaches,
    legal issues, and other problems.

    literature: The GitHub resource provides information about the repository's security
      features, including code scanning alerts, dependency vulnerabilities, and security
      advisories. This data can be used to implement a Software Composition Analysis
      (SCA) process by identifying and analyzing the open source and third-party components
      used in the repository's codebase. By regularly scanning the repository for
      known vulnerabilities and licensing issues, organizations can proactively address
      potential risks and maintain the security and compliance of their software.
    name: GithubResource
    reason: The GitHub resource contains relevant security data that can be used to
      implement an SCA process. The code_scanning_alerts, dependency_graph, security_advisories,
      and vulnerability_alerts fields provide information about potential vulnerabilities,
      dependencies, and security issues in the repository's codebase.
