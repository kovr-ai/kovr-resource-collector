  literature: Proper access control mechanisms are essential for ensuring that only
    authorized users or entities can access and perform operations on sensitive data,
    resources, or functionalities within an application or system. Implementing robust
    access control measures helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    potential misuse or abuse of privileged operations. This check validates that
    the application or system has implemented appropriate access control mechanisms,
    such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC),
    or other industry-standard access control models. Failure to implement proper
    access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential
    security breaches.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events for your account. It provides a log of activities that can be used to
      implement proper access control mechanisms by monitoring and auditing user actions
      and API calls. CloudTrail logs can be analyzed to identify unauthorized access
      attempts, policy violations, or suspicious activities, enabling organizations
      to take appropriate actions to enforce access control policies and protect sensitive
      resources.

    reason: CloudTrail logs can be used to monitor and audit user activities, API
      calls, and resource access, which is essential for implementing proper access
      control mechanisms. By analyzing CloudTrail logs, organizations can identify
      unauthorized access attempts, policy violations, or suspicious activities, and
      take appropriate actions to enforce access control policies and protect sensitive
      resources.
