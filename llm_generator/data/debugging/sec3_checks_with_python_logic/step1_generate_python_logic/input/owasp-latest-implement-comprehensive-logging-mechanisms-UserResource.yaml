  literature: Comprehensive logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining visibility
    into system activities, detecting potential security incidents, and enabling effective
    incident response and forensic analysis. Logging captures detailed information
    about user actions, system events, and security-related activities, providing
    a trail of evidence that can be used to investigate and respond to security breaches,
    policy violations, or operational issues. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
    helps organizations meet compliance requirements, identify and mitigate risks,
    and maintain accountability. Without proper logging, it becomes challenging to
    detect and respond to security incidents, leaving systems vulnerable to various
    threats.

    literature: The Google UserResource contains information related to user accounts
      and their associated details. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
      for this resource can help track user activities, detect potential security
      incidents, and enable effective incident response and forensic analysis. Relevant
      logging mechanisms may include capturing user login attempts, password changes,
      account modifications, and other security-related events.
    name: UserResource
    reason: The UserResource contains critical user account information and security
      settings. Logging changes to these fields can provide visibility into user activities,
      account modifications, and security-related events, which aligns with the security
      check's objective of implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms.
