  literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check validates that applications
    and systems are configured with secure default settings and configurations. Many
    software products and services come with default configurations that prioritize
    ease of use and functionality over security. These default settings often have
    known vulnerabilities, weak security controls, or unnecessary services enabled,
    which can expose the system to various security risks. By enforcing secure defaults,
    this check helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    other security incidents caused by insecure configurations.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check is applicable to AWS
      IAM resources as they control access and permissions within an AWS account.
      IAM policies define the allowed and denied actions for users, groups, and roles.
      By analyzing the default policies and their configurations, this check can identify
      insecure defaults that may grant excessive permissions or enable unnecessary
      services, increasing the attack surface.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: IAM policies and user access keys directly impact the security posture
      of an AWS account. Analyzing their default configurations is crucial to ensure
      secure defaults are enforced.
