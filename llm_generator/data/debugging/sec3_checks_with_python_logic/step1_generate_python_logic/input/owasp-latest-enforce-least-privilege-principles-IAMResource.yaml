  literature: The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security concept that
    restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only those permissions
    required to perform authorized tasks. By enforcing least privilege, organizations
    can reduce their attack surface, limit potential damage from malicious actors,
    and mitigate the risks associated with excessive permissions. This check validates
    that systems and applications adhere to the least privilege principle, ensuring
    that users, processes, and services operate with the minimum necessary privileges
    to accomplish their intended functions, and no more. Implementing least privilege
    is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture and protecting sensitive
    data and systems from unauthorized access or misuse.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is highly relevant for implementing the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privilege-principles'
      security check. This resource contains information about AWS Identity and Access
      Management (IAM) policies and user access keys, which are critical components
      for enforcing the principle of least privilege. By analyzing the policies and
      user permissions, you can ensure that users, processes, and services operate
      with the minimum necessary privileges required to perform their intended tasks,
      and no more.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM policies and user access keys,
      which are essential for evaluating and enforcing least privilege principles.
      By inspecting the policy statements, allowed actions, and assigned resources,
      you can determine if users and services have excessive permissions. Additionally,
      analyzing user access keys can help identify potential misuse or unauthorized
      access.
