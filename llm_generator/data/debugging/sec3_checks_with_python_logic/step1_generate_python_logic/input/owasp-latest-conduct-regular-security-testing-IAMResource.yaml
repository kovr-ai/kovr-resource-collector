  literature: Regular security testing is a crucial practice in cybersecurity to identify
    vulnerabilities, assess the effectiveness of security controls, and ensure the
    overall security posture of an organization. This check validates whether an organization
    conducts regular security testing, such as penetration testing, vulnerability
    assessments, and code reviews, to proactively identify and mitigate potential
    security risks. Failure to perform regular security testing can leave an organization
    vulnerable to cyber threats, data breaches, and compliance violations.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement regular security testing
      by analyzing the policies attached to IAM users and roles. By reviewing the
      policies, you can identify any overly permissive or risky permissions that could
      potentially be exploited by attackers. Additionally, you can check for compliance
      with least privilege principles and ensure that users and roles only have the
      necessary permissions required for their job functions.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM policies, user access keys, and
      MFA device information, which are crucial for assessing the security posture
      of an AWS account and identifying potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
