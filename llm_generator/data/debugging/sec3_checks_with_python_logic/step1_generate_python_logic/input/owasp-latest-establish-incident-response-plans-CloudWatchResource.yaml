  literature: Establishing incident response plans is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity
    preparedness. It involves creating a comprehensive set of procedures and protocols
    to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents or data
    breaches. An incident response plan outlines the roles, responsibilities, and
    actions to be taken by the organization in the event of a security incident, ensuring
    a coordinated and efficient response. This check validates the existence and adequacy
    of such plans, which are essential for minimizing the impact of security incidents,
    protecting sensitive data, maintaining business continuity, and complying with
    regulatory requirements. By having well-defined incident response plans in place,
    organizations can respond swiftly and effectively to security incidents, mitigate
    potential damages, and enhance their overall cybersecurity posture.

    literature: CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS
      that can play a crucial role in establishing incident response plans. It allows
      you to collect and analyze logs, metrics, and events from various AWS resources
      and applications. This data can be used to detect and respond to security incidents,
      such as unauthorized access attempts, system failures, or performance issues.
      By setting up CloudWatch alarms and integrating them with other AWS services
      like AWS Lambda or Amazon SNS, you can automate incident response actions, such
      as triggering notifications, executing remediation scripts, or invoking incident
      response workflows.
    name: CloudWatchResource
    reason: CloudWatch provides essential monitoring and logging capabilities that
      can be leveraged to detect security incidents and trigger appropriate response
      actions. By setting up alarms, metric filters, and log groups, you can monitor
      various aspects of your AWS resources and applications, and define automated
      actions to be taken when specific conditions are met, such as sending notifications
      or invoking incident response workflows.
