  literature: Comprehensive logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining visibility
    into system activities, detecting potential security incidents, and enabling effective
    incident response and forensic analysis. Logging captures detailed information
    about user actions, system events, and security-related activities, providing
    a trail of evidence that can be used to investigate and respond to security breaches,
    policy violations, or operational issues. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
    helps organizations meet compliance requirements, identify and mitigate risks,
    and maintain accountability. Without proper logging, it becomes challenging to
    detect and respond to security incidents, leaving systems vulnerable to various
    threats.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables comprehensive logging of
      account activity across AWS services and resources. It captures API calls, console
      actions, and other events, providing a detailed audit trail for security analysis,
      resource change tracking, and compliance monitoring. By configuring CloudTrail
      trails with appropriate event selectors and log file validation, organizations
      can implement comprehensive logging mechanisms that capture critical system
      activities, user actions, and security-related events.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: AWS CloudTrail provides comprehensive logging capabilities that align
      with the security check's requirement for implementing comprehensive logging
      mechanisms. The resource's field paths allow for configuring event selectors,
      data resources, management event inclusion, read/write event types, log file
      validation, and other settings to capture detailed system activities and security-related
      events.
