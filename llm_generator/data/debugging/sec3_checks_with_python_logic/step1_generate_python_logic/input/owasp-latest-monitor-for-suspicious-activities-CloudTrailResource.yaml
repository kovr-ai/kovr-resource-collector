  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to detect and alert on any suspicious or anomalous activities within an organization's
    systems and applications. It continuously monitors user behavior, system logs,
    network traffic, and other relevant data sources to identify potential security
    threats or unauthorized actions. This check is crucial because it helps organizations
    proactively identify and respond to potential security incidents, such as unauthorized
    access attempts, data exfiltration, or malicious insider activities. By monitoring
    for suspicious activities, organizations can take timely action to mitigate risks,
    investigate incidents, and prevent further damage or data breaches.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is highly applicable for implementing
      the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' security check. CloudTrail
      is a service that records AWS API calls and related events, providing a comprehensive
      audit trail of activities across your AWS account. By configuring CloudTrail
      trails and event selectors, you can capture and monitor various types of events,
      including management events, data events, and insights events. This allows you
      to detect and investigate suspicious or anomalous activities within your AWS
      environment, such as unauthorized access attempts, policy changes, or data exfiltration.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource provides comprehensive logging and monitoring
      capabilities for AWS API calls and events, allowing you to detect and investigate
      suspicious or anomalous activities within your AWS environment. By configuring
      CloudTrail trails, event selectors, and insight selectors, you can capture and
      analyze various types of events, including management events, data events, and
      insights events, which are essential for implementing the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
      security check.
