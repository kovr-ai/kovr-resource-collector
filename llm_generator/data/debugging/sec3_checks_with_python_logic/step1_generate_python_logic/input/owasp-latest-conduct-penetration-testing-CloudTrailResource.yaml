  literature: Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, is
    a simulated cyber attack against an organization's computer systems, networks,
    and web applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be
    exploited by malicious actors. It is an essential practice in cybersecurity to
    proactively identify and mitigate potential security risks before they can be
    exploited by real-world attackers. Conducting regular penetration testing helps
    organizations assess the effectiveness of their security controls, identify gaps
    in their defenses, and prioritize remediation efforts. By simulating real-world
    attack scenarios, penetration testing provides valuable insights into an organization's
    security posture and helps strengthen its overall cybersecurity resilience.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events for your account. It provides a comprehensive audit trail of all activities
      across your AWS infrastructure, which can be invaluable for conducting penetration
      testing and identifying potential security vulnerabilities. By analyzing CloudTrail
      logs, security teams can simulate attack scenarios, identify misconfigurations,
      and assess the effectiveness of security controls. CloudTrail's event selectors
      and data resource filters allow you to customize the types of events and resources
      to log, enabling targeted penetration testing efforts.

    reason: AWS CloudTrail provides detailed logging and auditing capabilities that
      are essential for conducting comprehensive penetration testing and identifying
      potential security vulnerabilities across AWS resources and services. By configuring
      CloudTrail event selectors and data resource filters, security teams can capture
      relevant API activity and simulate various attack scenarios to assess the effectiveness
      of security controls.
