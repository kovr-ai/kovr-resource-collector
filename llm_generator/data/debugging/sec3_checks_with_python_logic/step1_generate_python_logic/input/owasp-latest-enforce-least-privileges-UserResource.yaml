  literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check validates that applications
    and systems follow the principle of least privilege, which is a fundamental security
    concept that restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only
    those permissions that are essential for performing their intended functions.
    Granting excessive privileges increases the potential attack surface and risk
    of unauthorized access or misuse. This check helps mitigate threats like privilege
    escalation, unauthorized data access, and malicious code execution by ensuring
    that entities operate with the minimum necessary permissions.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check aims to ensure that
      the Google User resource follows the principle of least privilege by granting
      only the necessary permissions required for the user's intended functions. This
      mitigates risks like unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, and malicious
      code execution. To implement this check, the relevant field paths should be
      analyzed to determine if the user has excessive privileges or access rights.
    name: UserResource
    reason: The Google User resource contains fields that can indicate the user's
      administrative privileges, IP whitelisting status, organizational unit path,
      and two-factor authentication enrollment, which are relevant for assessing whether
      the user has more access than necessary.
