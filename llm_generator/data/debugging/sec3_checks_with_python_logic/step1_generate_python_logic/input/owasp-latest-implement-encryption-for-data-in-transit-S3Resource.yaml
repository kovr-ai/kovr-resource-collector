  literature: Data in transit refers to any data that is being transmitted across
    a network or communication channel. Implementing encryption for data in transit
    is a crucial security measure to protect sensitive information from being intercepted
    or eavesdropped by unauthorized parties. Without proper encryption, data transmitted
    over networks can be easily captured and read by attackers, leading to data breaches
    and compromised confidentiality. Encrypting data in transit ensures that even
    if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable and secure, preventing unauthorized
    access and maintaining data integrity. This check validates that appropriate encryption
    mechanisms are in place for all data transmissions, ensuring the confidentiality
    and integrity of sensitive information during transit.

    literature: The S3 resource in AWS is applicable for implementing encryption for
      data in transit as per the OWASP security check. S3 buckets can be configured
      to enforce encryption of data in transit using SSL/TLS when transferring data
      over the network. This ensures that all data transmitted to and from the S3
      bucket is encrypted, protecting it from unauthorized access or interception.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3 resource provides configuration options to enable encryption for
      data in transit using SSL/TLS. The relevant field paths are buckets[].encryption.enabled
      and buckets[].encryption.type, which allow specifying if encryption is enabled
      and the type of encryption used.
