  category: authentication
  control_names:
  - NIST-800-53-IA-2
  - ISO-27001-A.9.4.2
  literature: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires
    users to provide two or more forms of authentication to verify their identity
    before granting access to a system, application, or resource. This check validates
    that MFA is implemented and enforced for all user accounts, ensuring an additional
    layer of security beyond just a password. MFA significantly reduces the risk of
    unauthorized access, even if one factor (e.g., a password) is compromised. It
    is an essential security control to protect against various attack vectors, such
    as brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and phishing attempts.

    literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud represents a user account within
      an organization. To implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for this resource,
      you need to leverage the security_info fields. The security_info.isEnrolledIn2Sv
      field indicates whether the user is enrolled in Google's Two-Step Verification
      (2SV), which is their implementation of MFA. The security_info.isEnforcedIn2Sv
      field shows if 2SV is enforced for that user account.
    name: UserResource
    reason: The UserResource contains fields specifically related to multi-factor
      authentication enrollment and enforcement, making it applicable for this security
      check.
