  - NIST-800-53-AC-3
  - ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: Proper access control mechanisms are essential for ensuring that only
    authorized users or entities can access and perform operations on sensitive data,
    resources, or functionalities within an application or system. Implementing robust
    access control measures helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    potential misuse or abuse of privileged operations. This check validates that
    the application or system has implemented appropriate access control mechanisms,
    such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC),
    or other industry-standard access control models. Failure to implement proper
    access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential
    security breaches.
