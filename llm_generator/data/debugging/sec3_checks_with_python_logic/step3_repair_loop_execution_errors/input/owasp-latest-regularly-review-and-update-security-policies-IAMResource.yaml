  literature: Security policies are essential guidelines that outline an organization's
    approach to protecting its information assets and maintaining a secure computing
    environment. These policies define rules, procedures, and best practices for various
    security domains, such as access control, data protection, incident response,
    and risk management. Regular review and updates of security policies are crucial
    to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness in addressing evolving threats,
    technological advancements, and changing business requirements. Outdated or inadequate
    security policies can leave organizations vulnerable to cyber attacks, data breaches,
    and regulatory non-compliance. By regularly reviewing and updating security policies,
    organizations can identify and address gaps, incorporate new security controls,
    and align their policies with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.
