    description: If the check fails or partially passes, it indicates that the access
      controls defined in IAM policies may not be properly implemented or enforced
      on the server-side. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
      other security vulnerabilities.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the IAM policies and their statements to identify any overly permissive
      or misconfigured access controls.
    - Ensure that the 'Action' and 'Resource' fields in the policy statements are
      properly defined and follow the principle of least privilege.
    - Implement conditions in the policy statements to further restrict access based
      on specific requirements or scenarios.
    - Review user access keys and MFA devices to ensure that access controls are properly
      enforced for individual users.
    - Consider implementing additional security controls, such as AWS Security Token
      Service (STS) for temporary, limited-privilege credentials.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. In the context of AWS IAM resources, this check can be implemented
    by analyzing the IAM policies and their statements to ensure that access controls
    are properly defined and enforced. The IAM policies define the permissions granted
    to users, groups, and roles, and their statements specify the actions, resources,
    and conditions under which those permissions are granted.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Access controls defined in IAM policies are not properly implemented
      or enforced on the server-side.
    partial: Some access controls defined in IAM policies are properly implemented
      and enforced on the server-side, but others may require further review or remediation.
    success: Access controls defined in IAM policies are properly implemented and
      enforced on the server-side.
  reason: The IAM resource is valid for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side'
    check because it provides access to the IAM policies and their statements, which
    define the access controls for users, groups, and roles. Additionally, the resource
    includes information about user access keys and multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    devices, which are relevant for validating access controls.
