    description: If CloudWatch is not configured for centralized log management or
      log data is not being collected and stored properly, you need to set up log
      groups and configure log data collection from relevant AWS resources and applications.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the AWS resources and applications from which you need to collect
      log data.
    - 2. Create log groups in CloudWatch to store log data from these sources.
    - 3. Configure log data collection from the identified sources by setting up log
      agents or enabling log forwarding to the respective log groups.
    - 4. Review and adjust log group retention policies to ensure log data is retained
      for the desired period.
    - 5. Set up CloudWatch metric filters and alarms to monitor and receive notifications
      for specific log events or patterns.

  literature: AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects
    and manages log data from various AWS resources and applications. It provides
    centralized log management capabilities, allowing you to store, monitor, and analyze
    log data from multiple sources in a unified location. CloudWatch integrates with
    other AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS, to collect
    and process log data. By implementing centralized log management with CloudWatch,
    you can gain visibility into system activities, detect security incidents, troubleshoot
    issues, and comply with regulatory requirements.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not configured for centralized log management, or log data
      is not being collected and stored properly.
    partial: CloudWatch is partially configured for centralized log management, but
      some log data may not be collected or stored correctly.
    success: CloudWatch is configured for centralized log management, and log data
      is being collected and stored in log groups.
  reason: AWS CloudWatch provides centralized log management capabilities, allowing
    you to collect, store, and analyze log data from various AWS resources and applications.
    The 'log_groups' field paths are relevant for implementing this security check,
    as they provide information about the log groups, their configurations, and log
    data storage.
