    description: This security check is not directly applicable to the EC2Resource.
      However, if you are running applications on EC2 instances that accept user input,
      you should implement input validation and sanitization within those applications.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of your applications
    instructions:
    - Identify all sources of user input in your applications (e.g., web forms, API
      endpoints, file uploads)
    - Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms for each input source
    - Use secure coding practices and input validation libraries/frameworks
    - Test your input validation and sanitization mechanisms thoroughly
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly handle user input validation
    and sanitization. This security check is primarily applicable to application resources
    that accept and process user input, such as web servers, APIs, or databases. The
    EC2Resource represents Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, which are
    virtual servers used to run applications, but it does not inherently handle user
    input.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: User input is not being properly validated and sanitized, leaving the
      system vulnerable to injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    partial: Some user input is being validated and sanitized, but not all input sources
      are covered.
    success: All user input is properly validated and sanitized before processing.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not directly handle user input validation and sanitization.
    This security check is more relevant for application resources that accept and
    process user input, rather than infrastructure resources like EC2 instances.
