    description: To enforce least privilege principles in AWS, you should review and
      configure access control mechanisms such as AWS Identity and Access Management
      (IAM) policies, resource-based policies, and service control policies.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours (depending on the complexity of your AWS environment)
    instructions:
    - Review the IAM policies and roles associated with your AWS resources and services.
    - Apply the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions
      required for specific tasks or operations.
    - Regularly review and audit IAM policies and roles to identify and remove any
      excessive permissions.
    - Implement resource-based policies and service control policies where applicable
      to further restrict access and enforce least privilege.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    observability purposes, such as creating alarms, dashboards, and log groups. While
    it can provide insights into resource usage and activity, it does not directly
    enforce or manage access control and privilege levels for other AWS resources
    or services. Therefore, this resource is not directly applicable for implementing
    the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privilege-principles' security check.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for enforcing least privilege principles.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for enforcing least privilege principles.
    success: This resource is not applicable for enforcing least privilege principles.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource does not have the capability to enforce least privilege
    principles or manage access control for other AWS resources. It is a monitoring
    and observability service, not an access control mechanism.
