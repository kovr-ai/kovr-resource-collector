    description: To protect against brute force attacks, you need to implement appropriate
      controls at the application or service level running on the EC2 instances.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of the applications and the number
      of instances involved.
    instructions:
    - Identify the applications or services that require brute force protection.
    - Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    - Implement IP address blocking or rate limiting for excessive failed login attempts.
    - Consider implementing CAPTCHA challenges or other mechanisms to prevent automated
      brute force attacks.
    - Monitor and review authentication logs for suspicious activity.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly provide mechanisms to protect
    against brute force attacks on authentication systems. Brute force protection
    typically involves implementing controls at the application or service level,
    such as account lockouts, IP address blocking, and CAPTCHA challenges. While EC2
    instances can host applications that require brute force protection, the EC2 resource
    itself does not offer these capabilities.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource does not provide mechanisms to protect against brute
      force attacks on authentication systems.
    partial: The EC2 resource does not directly support brute force protection, but
      it can host applications that implement such measures.
    success: The EC2 resource has appropriate brute force protection mechanisms in
      place.
  reason: The EC2Resource in AWS is a compute service that provides virtual machines
    (instances) for running applications and workloads. It does not have built-in
    features or configurations specifically designed to protect against brute force
    attacks on authentication systems. Brute force protection measures are typically
    implemented at the application or service level, rather than at the infrastructure
    level.
