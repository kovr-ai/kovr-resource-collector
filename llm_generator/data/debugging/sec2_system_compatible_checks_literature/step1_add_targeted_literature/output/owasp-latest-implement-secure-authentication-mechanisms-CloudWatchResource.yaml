    description: To use CloudWatch for monitoring authentication-related events and
      metrics, you need to configure alarms, log groups, and metrics for the specific
      resources and applications that handle authentication.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the resources and applications that handle authentication in your environment.
    - Configure CloudWatch log groups to collect and store relevant logs from these
      resources and applications.
    - Define CloudWatch metrics and dimensions to track authentication-related metrics,
      such as failed login attempts, brute-force attacks, and session hijacking attempts.
    - Create CloudWatch alarms to monitor and alert on these metrics and log events,
      based on your defined thresholds and conditions.
    - Configure appropriate actions for these alarms, such as sending notifications
      or triggering automated remediation workflows.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is a monitoring and observability service
    that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. While CloudWatch itself does not directly implement secure authentication
    mechanisms, it can be used to monitor and detect potential authentication-related
    issues or attacks on other resources and applications.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource is not configured to monitor and detect potential
      authentication-related issues or attacks.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource is partially configured to monitor and detect
      potential authentication-related issues or attacks, but additional configuration
      may be required.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to monitor and detect potential
      authentication-related issues or attacks.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource itself does not directly implement authentication
    mechanisms. It is a monitoring service that can be used to track and analyze authentication-related
    events and metrics from other resources and applications.
