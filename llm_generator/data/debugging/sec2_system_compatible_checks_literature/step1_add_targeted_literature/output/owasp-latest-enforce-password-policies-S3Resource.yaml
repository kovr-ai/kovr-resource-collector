  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies'
    focuses on validating the existence and enforcement of strong password policies
    within an organization or system. This includes requirements such as minimum password
    length, complexity rules, password expiration periods, and restrictions on password
    reuse. However, the AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) resource is a highly scalable
    object storage service designed for storing and retrieving data from the cloud.
    It does not have any direct relation to password policies or authentication mechanisms.
