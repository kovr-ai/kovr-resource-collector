    description: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is not applicable to
      AWS S3 buckets, as they are object storage resources and not web applications
      or APIs.

  literature: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a technique used to identify
    security vulnerabilities in web applications by simulating real-world attacks
    and analyzing the application's behavior and responses. It involves interacting
    with the running application from the outside, mimicking the actions of a malicious
    user or attacker. DAST tools are designed to test web applications and APIs for
    vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data
    exposure, XML external entities (XXE), and other security weaknesses that could
    be exploited by attackers.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for Dynamic Application Security Testing
      (DAST).
    partial: This resource is not applicable for Dynamic Application Security Testing
      (DAST).
    success: This resource is not applicable for Dynamic Application Security Testing
      (DAST).
  reason: The provided resource is an AWS S3 bucket, which is an object storage service.
    S3 buckets are not web applications or APIs, and therefore, are not suitable for
    conducting Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). DAST is specifically designed
    to test the security of web applications and APIs by simulating real-world attacks
    and analyzing their responses. S3 buckets are storage resources and do not have
    the same functionality or attack surface as web applications or APIs.
