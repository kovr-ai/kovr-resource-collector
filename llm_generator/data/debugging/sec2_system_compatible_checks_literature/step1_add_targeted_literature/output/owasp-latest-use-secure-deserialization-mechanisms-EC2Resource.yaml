    description: To address this security check, you need to review the applications
      running on the EC2 instances and ensure they use secure deserialization mechanisms.
    estimated_time: The time required to address this issue can vary significantly
      depending on the number of applications, their complexity, and the level of
      remediation needed. It could take anywhere from a few hours to several weeks
      or months.
    instructions:
    - Identify all applications running on the EC2 instances that perform deserialization
      operations.
    - Review the deserialization mechanisms used by each application and ensure they
      follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, whitelisting, and
      strict type constraints.
    - Update or replace any applications that use insecure deserialization mechanisms
      with secure alternatives.
    - Implement regular code reviews and security testing to identify and address
      any new deserialization vulnerabilities.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to secure deserialization
    mechanisms. Deserialization is a process that occurs within applications or services
    when converting serialized data into objects. This security check is focused on
    ensuring that applications use secure deserialization mechanisms to prevent code
    execution and data tampering attacks.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more applications running on the EC2 instances do not use secure
      deserialization mechanisms, leaving them vulnerable to code execution and data
      tampering attacks.
    partial: Some applications running on the EC2 instances use secure deserialization
      mechanisms, but others do not, leaving parts of the system vulnerable.
    success: The applications running on the EC2 instances use secure deserialization
      mechanisms to prevent code execution and data tampering attacks.
  reason: The EC2Resource represents Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, networking
    components, and related resources. It does not contain information about the application
    code or deserialization mechanisms used within applications running on the instances.
