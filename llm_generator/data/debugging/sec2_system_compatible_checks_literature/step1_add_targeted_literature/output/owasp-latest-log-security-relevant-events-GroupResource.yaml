    description: To properly implement the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events'
      check, you need to configure and enable logging for security-relevant events
      within the appropriate Google Cloud services or resources that handle logging
      and auditing.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the relevant Google Cloud services or resources that handle logging
      and auditing for your environment.
    - 2. Review the logging and auditing configurations for those services or resources
      to ensure that security-relevant events are being captured.
    - 3. Enable or configure logging for security-relevant events if it is not already
      enabled or properly configured.
    - 4. Set up appropriate log retention policies and storage locations to ensure
      that security-relevant logs are retained for the desired period.
    - 5. Implement log monitoring and analysis processes to review and analyze security-relevant
      logs for potential incidents or threats.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. However, the Google GroupResource does not appear to be
    directly related to logging or auditing security events. This resource represents
    a group of users or entities within the Google Cloud environment, and its fields
    primarily contain information about the group's metadata, such as its name, description,
    and membership details.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The system is not properly logging security-relevant events, which may
      hinder incident response and forensic analysis capabilities.
    partial: The system is partially logging security-relevant events, but some events
      may not be captured or recorded properly.
    success: The system is properly logging security-relevant events, enabling effective
      incident response and forensic analysis.
  reason: The Google GroupResource is not directly applicable for implementing the
    'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check, as it does not contain information
    or configurations related to logging security events. This resource is primarily
    used for managing user groups and their membership details within the Google Cloud
    environment.
