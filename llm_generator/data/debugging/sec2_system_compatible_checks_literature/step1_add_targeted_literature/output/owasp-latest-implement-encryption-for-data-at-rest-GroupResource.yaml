    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing encryption of data
      at rest. To address this security check, you need to configure encryption for
      cloud storage services, databases, and other persistent storage mediums that
      store sensitive data.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the number of resources and complexity of the
      environment.
    instructions:
    - Identify all cloud resources and services that store sensitive data at rest.
    - Enable encryption at rest for each identified resource, following best practices
      for encryption algorithms and key management.
    - Regularly review and update encryption configurations to ensure compliance with
      the latest security standards and regulations.

  literature: The Google GroupResource represents a group of users within an organization.
    It does not directly relate to data storage or encryption of data at rest. This
    security check is focused on ensuring that sensitive data stored in cloud storage,
    databases, or other persistent storage mediums is encrypted to protect it from
    unauthorized access or data breaches.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Data at rest is not encrypted, leaving sensitive information vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    partial: Some data at rest is encrypted, but not all storage mediums or data types
      are covered.
    success: All data at rest is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms
      and key management practices.
  reason: The GroupResource is a representation of a user group and does not contain
    any information about data storage or encryption mechanisms. It is not applicable
    for implementing encryption of data at rest.
