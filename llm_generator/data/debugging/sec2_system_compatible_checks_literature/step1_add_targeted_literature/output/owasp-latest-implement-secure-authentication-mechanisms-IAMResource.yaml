    description: 'If IAM is not configured with secure authentication mechanisms,
      follow these steps to remediate the issue:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Enable MFA for all IAM users with access to sensitive resources or privileged
      roles.
    - Configure a strong password policy for IAM users, enforcing complexity requirements,
      expiration, and preventing password reuse.
    - Review and update IAM policies to follow the principle of least privilege, granting
      only the necessary permissions required for each user or role.
    - Regularly review and rotate IAM access keys and secret access keys.
    - Implement centralized authentication mechanisms like SAML or OpenID Connect
      for federated access.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing secure authentication
    mechanisms as per the OWASP latest guidelines. IAM (Identity and Access Management)
    is the core authentication and authorization service in AWS that allows you to
    manage users, groups, roles, and their associated permissions. By properly configuring
    IAM policies, you can enforce secure authentication practices such as multi-factor
    authentication (MFA), password policies, and access controls.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM is not configured with secure authentication mechanisms, leaving
      the AWS account vulnerable to authentication attacks.
    partial: IAM has some secure authentication mechanisms implemented, but additional
      measures are required to fully comply with OWASP guidelines.
    success: IAM is configured with secure authentication mechanisms such as MFA,
      strong password policies, and least privilege access controls.
  reason: The IAMResource provides the necessary configuration options and settings
    to implement secure authentication mechanisms as recommended by OWASP. It allows
    you to enforce MFA, manage user credentials, and define granular access policies.
