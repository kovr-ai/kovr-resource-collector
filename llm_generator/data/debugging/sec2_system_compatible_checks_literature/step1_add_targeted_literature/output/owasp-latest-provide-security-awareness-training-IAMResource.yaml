    description: 'If IAM users are found to have not completed the required security
      awareness training, or if their access is not properly restricted based on training
      completion, the following steps should be taken:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial remediation, ongoing monitoring required
    instructions:
    - Identify the IAM users who have not completed the training or have inappropriate
      access.
    - Enroll or re-enroll those users in the security awareness training program.
    - Review and update the relevant IAM policies to enforce access restrictions based
      on training completion.
    - Monitor user activity and access logs to ensure compliance with the updated
      policies.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement security awareness training
    for employees. The 'users' field path contains information about IAM users, including
    their access keys, MFA devices, and associated policies. By analyzing the policies
    attached to each user, you can identify if there are any policies related to security
    awareness training, such as mandatory training requirements or access restrictions
    based on training completion. Additionally, you can use the access key information
    to monitor user activity and ensure that only authorized users with proper training
    have access to sensitive resources.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more IAM users have not completed the required security awareness
      training, and their access is not properly restricted.
    partial: Some IAM users have completed the required security awareness training,
      but others have not, and access restrictions may not be consistently applied.
    success: All IAM users have completed the required security awareness training,
      and their access is properly restricted based on training completion.
  reason: The IAMResource provides information about IAM users, their access keys,
    MFA devices, and associated policies, which can be used to implement and enforce
    security awareness training requirements.
