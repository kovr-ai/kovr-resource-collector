    description: To protect against session hijacking attacks, you need to implement
      secure session management practices within the applications running on the EC2
      instances.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of the application and the number
      of instances involved.
    instructions:
    - Use secure session tokens or session IDs that are difficult to guess or predict.
    - Implement session timeouts and automatically terminate inactive sessions after
      a specified period.
    - Protect session tokens from being exposed in URLs, logs, or other insecure channels.
    - Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) to transmit session tokens.
    - Implement additional security measures like IP address validation, user agent
      validation, and session binding.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to protecting against
    session hijacking attacks. Session management and protection mechanisms are typically
    implemented at the application layer, rather than at the infrastructure level
    of EC2 instances or networking resources.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource does not provide any mechanisms to protect against session
      hijacking attacks.
    partial: The EC2 resource does not directly address session hijacking protection,
      but related security measures may be implemented at the application layer.
    success: The EC2 resource configurations adequately protect against session hijacking
      attacks.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any fields or configurations directly related
    to session management or protection against session hijacking attacks. These security
    measures are typically implemented within the application code or web server configurations
    running on the EC2 instances.
