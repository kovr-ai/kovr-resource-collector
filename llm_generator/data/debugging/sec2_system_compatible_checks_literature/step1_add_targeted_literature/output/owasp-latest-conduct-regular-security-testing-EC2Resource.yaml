    description: To address this issue, the organization should establish a comprehensive
      security testing program that includes regular penetration testing, vulnerability
      assessments, and code reviews.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement a comprehensive security testing
      program can vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization, but
      it typically takes several months to establish the necessary processes, policies,
      and resources.
    instructions:
    - Develop a security testing policy and schedule that aligns with industry best
      practices and regulatory requirements.
    - Engage qualified security professionals or third-party vendors to perform penetration
      testing and vulnerability assessments on a regular basis.
    - Implement secure coding practices and conduct code reviews to identify and remediate
      vulnerabilities in software applications.
    - Document and track the findings from security testing activities, and prioritize
      the remediation of identified vulnerabilities.
    - Continuously monitor and update the security testing program to address evolving
      threats and changes in the organization's technology landscape.

  literature: The provided AWS EC2Resource does not contain any information related
    to security testing practices or procedures. This resource primarily deals with
    EC2 instance configurations, networking components like VPCs and security groups,
    and other infrastructure-level details. It does not provide insights into an organization's
    security testing processes, such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessments,
    or code reviews.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not conduct regular security testing, leaving it
      vulnerable to cyber threats, data breaches, and compliance violations.
    partial: Not applicable
    success: The organization conducts regular security testing, including penetration
      testing, vulnerability assessments, and code reviews, to identify and mitigate
      potential security risks.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any relevant data points or attributes
    that can be used to determine if an organization conducts regular security testing.
    This resource is focused on the infrastructure and configuration aspects of EC2,
    rather than security testing processes.
