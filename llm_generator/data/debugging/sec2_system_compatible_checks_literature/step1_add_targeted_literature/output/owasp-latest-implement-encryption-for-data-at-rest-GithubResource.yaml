  field_paths: []
  fix_details:
    automation_available: true
    description: Since the GitHub resource does not provide any means to configure
      or manage encryption for data at rest, the fix would involve using other GitHub
      APIs or tools to enable and manage encryption for the repository's data storage.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - 1. Consult the GitHub documentation on enabling encryption for data at rest
      for your repository or organization.
    - 2. Use the appropriate GitHub APIs or tools to configure and enable encryption
      for your repository's data storage.
    - 3. Verify that encryption is properly configured and enabled for your repository's
      data storage.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The GitHub resource provided does not contain any information related
    to data storage or encryption mechanisms. It primarily contains metadata about
    the GitHub repository, such as collaborators, issues, pull requests, and security
    advisories. While GitHub does offer encryption for data at rest, this specific
    resource does not provide any means to implement or configure that encryption.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub repository does not have encryption for data at rest configured
      or enabled.
    partial: Not applicable, as the resource is either fully valid or invalid for
      this check.
    success: The GitHub repository has encryption for data at rest properly configured
      and enabled.
  reason: The GitHub resource does not contain any fields or properties related to
    data storage or encryption configurations. It is focused on providing metadata
    and information about the repository itself, rather than the underlying infrastructure
    or storage mechanisms used by GitHub.
