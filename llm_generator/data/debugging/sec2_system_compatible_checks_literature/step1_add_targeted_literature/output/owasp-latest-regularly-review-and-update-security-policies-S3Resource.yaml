      departments (IT, legal, compliance, etc.).

      personnel and systems.
    - Implement a mechanism for tracking and monitoring policy compliance across the
      organization.

  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-policies'
    focuses on the regular review and update of security policies within an organization.
    While security policies are essential for maintaining a secure computing environment,
    this check is not directly applicable to the AWS S3 resource itself. S3 is an
    object storage service, and it does not have the capability to define, review,
    or update organizational security policies.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization does not have a process in place to regularly review
      and update its security policies, leaving it vulnerable to cyber threats and
      regulatory non-compliance.
    partial: N/A
    success: Your organization regularly reviews and updates its security policies
      to address evolving threats, technological advancements, and changing business
      requirements.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not have the capability
    to define, review, or update organizational security policies. This security check
    is more relevant to an organization's overall security governance processes and
    procedures.
