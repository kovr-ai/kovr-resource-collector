    description: To enforce password policies in AWS, you should review and configure
      the appropriate settings at the account or identity provider level, such as
      AWS IAM or other integrated identity providers.
    estimated_time: 15-30 minutes
    instructions:
    - 1. Access the AWS IAM service and navigate to the Account Settings section.
    - 2. Review and configure the Password Policy settings according to your organization's
      requirements, such as minimum password length, complexity rules, and expiration
      periods.
    - 3. If using other identity providers integrated with AWS services, review and
      configure the password policy settings within those providers according to their
      respective documentation.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to enforcing password
    policies for authentication mechanisms. Password policies are typically implemented
    and managed at the account or service level, such as AWS Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) or other identity providers integrated with AWS services. The EC2Resource
    provides information about Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, networking components,
    and related resources, but it does not contain configuration details or settings
    related to password policies.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for enforcing password policies.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for enforcing password policies.
    success: This resource is not applicable for enforcing password policies.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any fields or configurations related to
    password policies or authentication mechanisms. Password policies are typically
    managed at a higher level, such as the AWS account or identity provider level,
    and are not specific to individual EC2 resources.
