    description: This security check is not applicable to the provided resource. However,
      to implement a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) based on OWASP
      guidelines, the organization should review and adopt the OWASP SSDLC practices
      throughout their software development process.
    estimated_time: The implementation time can vary significantly based on the organization's
      size, complexity, and existing software development practices. It may take several
      months to fully adopt and integrate the SSDLC process.
    instructions:
    - Establish a cross-functional team responsible for implementing and maintaining
      the SSDLC process.
    - Conduct a thorough assessment of the current software development practices
      and identify gaps against the OWASP SSDLC guidelines.
    - Develop and document a comprehensive SSDLC policy and procedures aligned with
      OWASP recommendations.
    - Provide training and awareness programs for developers, testers, and other stakeholders
      on secure coding practices and the SSDLC process.
    - Implement security controls and activities throughout the software development
      lifecycle, including secure requirements gathering, threat modeling, secure
      coding practices, security testing, and secure deployment.

  literature: The OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of
    best practices and guidelines for building secure software from the ground up.
    It emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations throughout
    the entire software development process, from requirements gathering and design
    to implementation, testing, and deployment. This security check is focused on
    ensuring that an organization has adopted and follows a secure SSDLC, which is
    crucial for developing secure and resilient applications that can withstand various
    cyber threats.

      development lifecycle (SSDLC) based on OWASP guidelines.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    success: The organization has adopted and follows a secure software development
      lifecycle (SSDLC) based on OWASP guidelines.
  reason: The provided resource 'GroupResource' from Google Cloud Platform is a resource
    related to managing groups and their memberships. It does not contain any information
    or configurations related to software development lifecycles or secure coding
    practices. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-adopt-a-secure-software-development-lifecycle-(ssdlc)'
