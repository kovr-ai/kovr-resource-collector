  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
    is focused on ensuring that web applications properly encode user input to prevent
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This involves sanitizing and escaping
    user-supplied data before rendering it in web pages to prevent the execution of
    malicious scripts. However, the provided AWS CloudTrail resource is a service
    that logs AWS account activity and does not directly relate to web application
    security or output encoding. CloudTrail is primarily used for auditing and monitoring
    purposes, not for implementing security controls within web applications.

  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to the AWS CloudTrail resource.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the AWS CloudTrail resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the AWS CloudTrail resource.
  reason: The AWS CloudTrail resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
    security check, as it is a logging and auditing service and does not directly
    handle user input or output encoding in web applications.
