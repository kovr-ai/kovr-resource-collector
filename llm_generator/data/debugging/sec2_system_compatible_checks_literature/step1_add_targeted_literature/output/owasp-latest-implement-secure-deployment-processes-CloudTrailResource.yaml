    description: If CloudTrail is not configured properly, it may not capture all
      relevant deployment activities, making it difficult to ensure secure deployment
      processes are followed.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes
    instructions:
    - Enable CloudTrail and ensure it is logging all API calls and events across all
      regions and services.
    - Configure CloudTrail to capture management events and data events related to
      deployment activities.
    - Enable log file validation to ensure the integrity of CloudTrail logs.
    - Configure CloudTrail to deliver logs to a secure and centralized S3 bucket for
      long-term storage and analysis.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is relevant for implementing secure deployment
    processes as it provides an audit trail of AWS API calls and related events. By
    enabling CloudTrail and configuring it properly, organizations can monitor and
    review activities across their AWS infrastructure, including deployments and changes
    made to resources. This visibility into deployment processes helps ensure proper
    security controls are applied and allows for investigation of potential security
    incidents.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured properly to capture and log deployment activities,
      increasing the risk of unauthorized or insecure deployments.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to capture deployment activities,
      but additional configuration is required to fully support secure deployment
      processes.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to capture and log all relevant deployment activities,
      enabling secure deployment processes.
  reason: CloudTrail provides an audit trail of AWS API calls and related events,
    which is essential for monitoring and reviewing deployment activities across the
    AWS infrastructure. By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it properly, organizations
    can ensure secure deployment processes are followed and investigate any potential
    security incidents.
