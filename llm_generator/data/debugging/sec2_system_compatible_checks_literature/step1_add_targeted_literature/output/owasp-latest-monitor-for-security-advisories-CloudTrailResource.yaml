    description: If CloudTrail is not configured to log relevant events, it needs
      to be enabled and properly configured to capture the necessary information for
      monitoring security advisories.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - 1. Enable CloudTrail if it is not already enabled.
    - 2. Configure CloudTrail to log events from relevant AWS services that may be
      affected by security advisories.
    - 3. Set up CloudTrail to deliver logs to a centralized location (e.g., S3 bucket)
      for analysis and monitoring.
    - 4. Integrate CloudTrail logs with security monitoring tools to receive alerts
      and notifications about potential security issues.

  literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related events
    for your account. It provides a log of activities that can be used to monitor
    for security advisories and potential threats. By configuring CloudTrail to log
    relevant events and integrating it with security monitoring tools, organizations
    can stay informed about security advisories and take appropriate actions to mitigate
    risks.

  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to log relevant events, making it difficult
      to monitor for security advisories.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to log relevant events, but additional
      configuration may be needed to effectively monitor for security advisories.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to log relevant events and can be used to monitor
      for security advisories.
  reason: AWS CloudTrail can be configured to log API calls and events related to
    various AWS services, including those that may be affected by security advisories.
    By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it to capture relevant events, organizations
    can monitor for potential security issues and take appropriate actions.
