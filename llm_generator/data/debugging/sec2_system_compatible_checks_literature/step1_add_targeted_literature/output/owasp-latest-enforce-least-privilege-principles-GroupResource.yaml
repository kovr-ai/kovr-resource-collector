    description: To ensure the principle of least privilege is enforced, review the
      roles and permissions assigned to the GroupResource and its members, and remove
      any unnecessary or excessive permissions.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the roles and permissions assigned to the GroupResource and its members.
    - Evaluate each role and permission to determine if it is strictly necessary for
      the intended tasks.
    - Remove any unnecessary or excessive roles and permissions from the GroupResource
      and its members.
    - Implement a process for periodic review and adjustment of roles and permissions
      to maintain least privilege.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a collection of
    entities, such as users or service accounts, that can be granted access to various
    resources. While this resource can be used to manage access control, it does not
    directly enforce the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege
    is typically implemented through granular access control mechanisms, such as IAM
    roles and permissions, which are applied to individual resources or services.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource is not configured to follow the principle of least
      privilege, with members granted excessive or unnecessary permissions.
    partial: Some members of the GroupResource are granted excessive permissions,
      while others follow the principle of least privilege.
    success: The GroupResource is configured to follow the principle of least privilege,
      with members granted only the necessary permissions to perform their authorized
      tasks.
  reason: The GroupResource itself does not directly enforce the principle of least
    privilege. It is a container for managing group memberships, but the actual implementation
    of least privilege occurs through the assignment of appropriate roles and permissions
    to the group or its members.
