    unique_id: owasp-latest-implement-secure-session-management
  field_paths: []
  fix_details:
    automation_available: false
    description: Since the UserResource is not directly applicable to secure session
      management, the fix would involve identifying and reviewing the relevant application
      components or services that handle session management functionality.
    estimated_time: The time required can vary significantly depending on the application's
      complexity and the extent of changes needed. It could range from a few hours
      for simple applications to several days or weeks for more complex systems.
    instructions:
    - Locate the application code or services responsible for session management,
      such as authentication, authorization, and session handling mechanisms.
    - Review the implementation details to ensure secure practices are followed, including
      generating unpredictable session identifiers, protecting session data integrity,
      setting appropriate session timeouts, and invalidating sessions after logout
      or inactivity.
    - Implement any missing or weak session management controls, following industry
      best practices and security guidelines.
    - Test and validate the secure session management implementation to ensure it
      effectively mitigates risks like session hijacking and unauthorized access.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' appears to be related to user account
    management in Google Workspace. While secure session management is an important
    aspect of access control, this resource does not seem to directly handle session
    management functionality. The fields provided relate to user profile information,
    contact details, organizational data, and security settings, but do not contain
    details about session identifiers, timeouts, or invalidation mechanisms.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure session management practices,
      leaving it vulnerable to session hijacking, unauthorized access, and other security
      risks.
    partial: The application partially implements secure session management practices,
      but there are gaps or weaknesses that need to be addressed.
    success: The application implements secure session management practices, including
      generating unpredictable session identifiers, protecting session data from tampering,
      setting appropriate session timeouts, and invalidating sessions after logout
      or inactivity.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any fields or properties directly related
    to implementing secure session management practices. It is focused on storing
    and managing user account data rather than handling session management functionality.
