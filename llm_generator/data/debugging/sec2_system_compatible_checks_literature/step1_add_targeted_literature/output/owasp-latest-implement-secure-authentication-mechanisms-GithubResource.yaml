    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing secure authentication
      mechanisms. To address this security check, you would need to review the application's
      codebase and infrastructure to ensure proper implementation of authentication
      mechanisms.

  literature: The OWASP latest secure authentication mechanisms check validates that
    the application implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect against
    common authentication attacks. This includes measures such as implementing proper
    password policies, multi-factor authentication, session management, and protection
    against brute-force and credential stuffing attacks. However, the provided GitHub
    resource does not appear to be directly related to implementing authentication
    mechanisms within an application.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure authentication mechanisms,
      leaving it vulnerable to common authentication attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect
      against common authentication attacks such as brute-force, credential stuffing,
      and session hijacking.
  reason: The GitHub resource provided contains information about a GitHub repository,
    such as its branches, collaborators, actions workflows, security advisories, and
    vulnerability alerts. While some of this information may be tangentially related
    to security, it does not directly address the implementation of secure authentication
    mechanisms within an application codebase or infrastructure.
