    description: Since the UserResource is not applicable for this check, no specific
      fix is required. However, to ensure the application uses industry-standard authentication
      protocols, you should review the authentication configuration and settings of
      the application or service being assessed.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the application or service.
    instructions:
    - Identify the authentication mechanisms and protocols used by the application
      or service.
    - Verify if the protocols used are industry-standard and secure, such as OAuth,
      OpenID Connect, or SAML.
    - If the protocols are outdated or insecure, update the application or service
      to use industry-standard authentication protocols.
    - Implement best practices for secure authentication, such as using strong encryption,
      secure credential storage, and multi-factor authentication.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly applicable
    for implementing the OWASP latest use industry standard authentication protocols
    check. This resource represents user information and metadata within the Google
    Workspace Admin SDK, but does not contain details about the authentication protocols
    or mechanisms used by the application or service.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use industry-standard authentication protocols
      and mechanisms, potentially exposing user credentials to various attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses industry-standard authentication protocols and mechanisms
      to securely authenticate users and protect their credentials.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any information related to authentication
    protocols or mechanisms used by the application or service. It primarily stores
    user profile data, contact information, and administrative details. To implement
    this check, you would need to analyze the authentication configuration and settings
    of the specific application or service being assessed.
