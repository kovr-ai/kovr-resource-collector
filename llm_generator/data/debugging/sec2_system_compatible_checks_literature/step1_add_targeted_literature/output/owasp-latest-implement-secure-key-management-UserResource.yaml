  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' from Google Cloud Platform does
    not appear to be directly related to secure key management practices. This resource
    represents user account information and does not contain any fields related to
    encryption keys, key management, or cryptographic operations. Secure key management
    typically involves managing encryption keys used for data protection, authentication,
    and secure communication. The UserResource does not seem to have any direct relevance
    to this security check.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application or system does not implement secure key management practices,
      putting sensitive data at risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other
      security incidents.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application or system implements secure key management practices,
      such as using strong encryption algorithms, properly generating and storing
      keys, regularly rotating keys, and securely distributing keys to authorized
      parties.
  reason: The UserResource represents user account details and does not contain any
    information or functionality related to encryption keys or key management practices.
    This resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-key-management'
    security check.
