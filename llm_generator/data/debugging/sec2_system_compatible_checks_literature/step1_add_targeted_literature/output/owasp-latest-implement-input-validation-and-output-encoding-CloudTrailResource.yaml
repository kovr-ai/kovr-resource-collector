    description: To address this security check, application developers need to implement
      input validation and output encoding within the application code.
    estimated_time: Highly variable, depending on the size and complexity of the application.
    instructions:
    - Review all user input sources (forms, APIs, etc.) and implement validation to
      sanitize and validate user-supplied data before processing.
    - Implement output encoding to ensure user-supplied data is properly encoded before
      rendering in web pages, API responses, etc.
    - Follow secure coding practices and use appropriate libraries/frameworks for
      input validation and output encoding.
    - Regularly test and review the application for code injection vulnerabilities
      (e.g., XSS, SQLi, CMDi).
  is_valid: false
  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. It does not directly implement input validation or output
    encoding for applications. These security measures need to be implemented within
    the application code itself to prevent code injection attacks.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to log all relevant API activity, and/or
      the application does not implement proper input validation and output encoding,
      leaving it vulnerable to code injection attacks.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to log relevant API activity, but
      the application may still be vulnerable to code injection attacks due to lack
      of input validation and output encoding.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to log all relevant API activity, and the application
      implements proper input validation and output encoding to prevent code injection
      attacks.
  reason: CloudTrail is a logging and monitoring service that records API calls made
    within an AWS account. It does not handle application input/output validation
    or encoding, which are code-level controls that must be implemented by the application
    developers.
