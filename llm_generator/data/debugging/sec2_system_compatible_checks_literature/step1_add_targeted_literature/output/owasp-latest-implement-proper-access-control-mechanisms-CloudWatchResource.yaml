    description: To implement proper access control mechanisms, you need to configure
      and use other AWS services or tools specifically designed for access control,
      such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Resource Access Manager
      (RAM), or AWS Organizations.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for basic setup, more time may be required for complex
      environments
    instructions:
    - Review your application architecture and identify the resources and data that
      require access control.
    - Implement appropriate access control mechanisms using AWS IAM, RAM, or Organizations
      based on your requirements.
    - Define and configure access control policies, roles, and permissions to restrict
      access to authorized users or entities.
    - Integrate the access control mechanisms with your application or system to enforce
      the defined policies.
    - Monitor and audit access-related events using CloudWatch or other monitoring
      tools.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It does not directly implement access control mechanisms for
    resources or data within an application or system. While CloudWatch can be used
    to monitor and log access-related events, it does not provide the functionality
    to define and enforce access control policies or rules.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource does not implement access control mechanisms
      as required by the security check.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource does not directly implement access control mechanisms,
      but can be used to monitor and log access-related events.
    success: The CloudWatch resource has appropriate access control mechanisms implemented.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is focused on monitoring and logging capabilities,
    and does not directly implement access control mechanisms as described in the
    security check. While it can be used to monitor access-related events, it does
    not provide the functionality to define and enforce access control policies or
    rules.
