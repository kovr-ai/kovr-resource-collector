    description: To implement secure software supply chain practices, organizations
      need to establish processes and controls across various areas, including source
      code management, build and deployment pipelines, third-party dependency management,
      and continuous monitoring and validation.
    estimated_time: Implementing secure software supply chain practices is a complex
      and ongoing process that may take several weeks or months, depending on the
      organization's size and existing security posture.
    instructions:
    - Implement secure coding practices and code review processes to ensure the quality
      and security of the source code.
    - Establish a secure build and deployment pipeline with automated security checks,
      code signing, and integrity verification.
    - Implement a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and manage
      third-party dependencies and vulnerabilities.
    - Implement continuous monitoring and validation processes to detect and respond
      to potential supply chain threats or compromises.
    - Establish secure access controls and audit trails for the software supply chain
      infrastructure and processes.
    - Develop and maintain a software supply chain security policy and provide training
      to relevant personnel.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing secure
    software supply chain practices. This resource provides information about EC2
    instances, networking components, and other infrastructure resources within an
    AWS account, but it does not cover the processes and controls for securing the
    software supply chain.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS account has not implemented secure software supply chain practices,
      leaving the software supply chain vulnerable to potential threats and vulnerabilities.
    partial: The AWS account has partially implemented secure software supply chain
      practices, but there are gaps or weaknesses that need to be addressed.
    success: The AWS account has implemented secure software supply chain practices
      to protect the integrity and security of software throughout its lifecycle.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any information or configurations related
    to software development, deployment pipelines, or supply chain security controls.
    It is focused on infrastructure resources rather than software supply chain practices.
