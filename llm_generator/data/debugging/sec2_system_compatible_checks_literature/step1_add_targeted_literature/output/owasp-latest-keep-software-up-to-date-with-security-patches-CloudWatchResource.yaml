    description: This check is not applicable to the CloudWatch resource. To keep
      software up-to-date with security patches, you should consider using other AWS
      services or tools specifically designed for patch management and software updates.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number of systems
      and the complexity of the software environment.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the software and systems that need to be kept up-to-date with security
      patches.
    - 2. Evaluate and implement appropriate patch management solutions, such as AWS
      Systems Manager Patch Manager, or third-party tools.
    - 3. Configure the patch management solution to automatically scan for and apply
      security patches and updates on a regular schedule.
    - 4. Monitor the patch management process and ensure that updates are being applied
      successfully.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It does not directly relate to keeping software up-to-date with
    security patches. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor and alert on various
    metrics, it does not have the capability to automatically apply security patches
    or updates to software and systems.
