  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring AWS account
    activity and events. It does not directly handle XML parsing or processing. Therefore,
    this resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers'
    security check, which focuses on ensuring the use of secure XML parsers to mitigate
    vulnerabilities like XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML Injection, and Denial
    of Service (DoS) attacks.

      check.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource does not handle XML parsing or processing, and
      therefore cannot implement the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' security
      check.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to use secure XML parsers for handling
      XML data.
