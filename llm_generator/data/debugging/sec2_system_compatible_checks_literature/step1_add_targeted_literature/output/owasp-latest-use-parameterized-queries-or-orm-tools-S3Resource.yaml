  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    is focused on preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries
    or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools in application code. This check is primarily
    applicable to application code and databases, rather than cloud storage resources
    like AWS S3 buckets.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 resources.
    partial: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 resources.
    success: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 resources.
  reason: AWS S3 is a cloud storage service for storing and retrieving data, and does
    not directly handle SQL queries or application code. Therefore, this security
    check is not applicable to S3 resources.
