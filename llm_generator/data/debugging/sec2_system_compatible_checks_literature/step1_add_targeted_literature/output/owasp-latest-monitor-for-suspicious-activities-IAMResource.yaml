    description: If suspicious activities are detected, remediation steps may include
      reviewing and updating IAM policies, rotating access keys, enabling MFA for
      users, and investigating any unauthorized access attempts.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the identified IAM policies for overly permissive statements and update
      them to follow the principle of least privilege.
    - Rotate any access keys that show suspicious activity or have been inactive for
      an extended period.
    - Enable MFA for all IAM users and enforce its usage.
    - Investigate any unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity patterns, and
      take appropriate action (e.g., disabling compromised accounts, increasing monitoring,
      etc.).

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
    security check. By analyzing the IAM policies, user access keys, and MFA device
    information, you can monitor for suspicious activities such as unauthorized access
    attempts, privilege escalation, or misuse of credentials. The policies field can
    be inspected for overly permissive statements, while the user access keys and
    MFA devices can be checked for unusual activity patterns or disabled MFA.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Suspicious activities were detected in the IAM policies, user access
      keys, or MFA device configurations. Review the findings and take appropriate
      action.
    partial: Some potential issues were identified in the IAM policies, user access
      keys, or MFA device configurations. Further investigation is recommended.
    success: No suspicious activities were detected in the IAM policies, user access
      keys, and MFA device configurations.
  reason: The IAMResource contains relevant information about IAM policies, user access
    keys, and MFA devices, which can be used to detect suspicious activities related
    to authentication, authorization, and access control.
