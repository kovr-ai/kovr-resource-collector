    description: To implement secure key management for your EC2 workloads, you should
      use AWS KMS, ACM, or Secrets Manager.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the sensitive data and applications that require encryption.
    - Create a customer master key (CMK) in AWS KMS or use AWS-managed CMKs.
    - Use the CMK to encrypt and decrypt data at rest and in transit.
    - Implement key rotation and auditing policies for the CMKs.
    - Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and rotate application secrets and
      credentials.
    - Use AWS Certificate Manager to provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates for
      secure communication.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to key management practices.
    EC2 instances are virtual machines that run applications and workloads, but they
    do not inherently handle encryption keys or key management. Key management is
    typically handled by other AWS services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
    AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), or AWS Secrets Manager.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource does not implement secure key management practices.
      Consider using AWS KMS, ACM, or Secrets Manager for key management.
    partial: The EC2 resource partially implements secure key management practices,
      but additional configuration is required.
    success: The EC2 resource implements secure key management practices.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any fields or configurations related to
    encryption key management. It represents EC2 instances, networking components
    like VPCs and security groups, but does not cover key management functionality.
