    description: To implement RBAC in Google Cloud, you need to configure access control
      policies and role assignments within Google Cloud Identity and Access Management
      (IAM).
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console and select the IAM & Admin service.
    - 2. Create custom roles or use predefined roles to define the necessary permissions
      and access levels.
    - 3. Assign roles to users, groups, or service accounts based on their job responsibilities
      and access requirements.
    - 4. Review and audit role assignments periodically to ensure proper access control.
    - 5. Implement least privilege principles by granting only the minimum required
      permissions.

  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly applicable
    for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This resource represents user
    information and attributes, but does not contain details about roles, permissions,
    or access control mechanisms. To implement RBAC, you would need to configure access
    control policies and role assignments within Google Cloud Identity and Access
    Management (IAM).
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource does not contain the necessary information to implement
      Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Please configure access control policies and
      role assignments within Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM).
    partial: The UserResource does not directly support Role-Based Access Control
      (RBAC) implementation. Additional configuration within Google Cloud Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) is required.
    success: The UserResource has been properly configured to support Role-Based Access
      Control (RBAC) within Google Cloud.
  reason: The UserResource contains user profile information, but does not include
    details about roles, permissions, or access control mechanisms required for implementing
    RBAC.
