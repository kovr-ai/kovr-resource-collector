    description: While CloudTrail does not directly protect against brute force attacks,
      it can be configured to log and monitor API activity, which can help detect
      and respond to potential brute force attacks.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - 1. Enable CloudTrail in all regions where you have AWS resources.
    - 2. Configure CloudTrail to log management events and read/write events for relevant
      AWS services.
    - 3. Configure CloudTrail to log data events for relevant AWS resources.
    - 4. Enable log file validation to ensure the integrity of CloudTrail logs.
    - 5. Configure CloudTrail to send logs to a secure and centralized location, such
      as an S3 bucket with appropriate access controls.
    - 6. Regularly review CloudTrail logs for potential security incidents, including
      signs of brute force attacks.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The CloudTrailResource in AWS is primarily used for logging and monitoring
    API activity across AWS services and resources. While it can provide valuable
    audit trails and insights into potential security incidents, it does not directly
    implement protection mechanisms against brute force attacks. Protecting against
    brute force attacks typically involves configuring access controls, account lockout
    policies, IP address blocking, and CAPTCHA challenges at the application or service
    level.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to log and monitor API activity, which could
      make it difficult to detect and respond to potential brute force attacks.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to log and monitor API activity, but
      additional configuration may be needed to ensure comprehensive audit trails
      for detecting potential brute force attacks.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to log and monitor API activity, providing valuable
      audit trails for detecting potential brute force attacks.
  reason: The CloudTrailResource is primarily focused on logging and monitoring API
    activity, but does not directly implement protection mechanisms against brute
    force attacks, which typically involve configuring access controls, account lockout
    policies, IP address blocking, and CAPTCHA challenges at the application or service
    level.
