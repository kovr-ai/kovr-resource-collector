  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
    is focused on preventing XML External Entity (XXE) attacks by disabling external
    entity processing in applications that parse XML input. This check is primarily
    applicable to web applications, web services, or other software components that
    handle XML data. The AWS CloudTrail resource is a service that logs AWS account
    activity and does not directly handle XML parsing or processing. Therefore, this
    security check is not directly applicable to the CloudTrail resource.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource does not handle XML parsing or processing, so
      this check is not applicable.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource does not handle XML parsing or processing, so
      this check is not applicable.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to disable XML external entity
      processing.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is a logging service that records AWS account activity
    and does not directly handle XML parsing or processing. As such, the security
    check related to disabling XML external entity processing is not directly applicable
    to this resource.
