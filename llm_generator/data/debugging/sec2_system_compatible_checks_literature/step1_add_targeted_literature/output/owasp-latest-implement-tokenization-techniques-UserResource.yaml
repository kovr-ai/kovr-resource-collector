    description: Since the UserResource does not handle sensitive data or tokenization,
      no specific fixes are required for this resource. However, if your application
      or system stores sensitive data, you should implement tokenization techniques
      to protect that data.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement tokenization techniques can vary
      depending on the complexity of your application or system, the amount of sensitive
      data involved, and the specific tokenization solution chosen. It may take several
      weeks or months to fully implement and test a robust tokenization solution.
    instructions:
    - Identify the sensitive data elements in your application or system that require
      protection (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers, personally identifiable
      information).
    - Implement a tokenization solution that replaces the sensitive data with non-sensitive
      placeholders (tokens) and stores the original data in a secure token vault.
    - Ensure that the tokenization process is applied consistently across all data
      flows, both at rest and in transit.
    - Regularly review and update your tokenization implementation to address any
      new security threats or compliance requirements.

  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' appears to be related to user account
    information in Google Workspace. It does not contain any fields or properties
    directly related to tokenization techniques for protecting sensitive data. Tokenization
    is a data security method that replaces sensitive data elements with non-sensitive
    placeholders (tokens) to minimize exposure and risk. This resource does not seem
    to handle or store sensitive data that would require tokenization.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource does not implement tokenization techniques to protect
      sensitive data.
    partial: The UserResource partially implements tokenization techniques, but additional
      measures are needed to fully protect sensitive data.
    success: The UserResource implements tokenization techniques to protect sensitive
      data at rest and in transit.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any fields or properties related to sensitive
    data storage or tokenization techniques. It is primarily focused on user account
    details and metadata, which do not directly align with the requirements of the
    'owasp-latest-implement-tokenization-techniques' security check.
