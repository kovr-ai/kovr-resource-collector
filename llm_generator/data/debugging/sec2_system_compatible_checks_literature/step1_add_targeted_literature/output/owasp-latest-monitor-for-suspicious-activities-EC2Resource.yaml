    description: To implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
      check, you need to integrate monitoring solutions that can collect and analyze
      data from various sources, such as user activity logs, system logs, network
      traffic, and security event data.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the relevant data sources within your AWS environment that need
      to be monitored for suspicious activities, such as CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow
      Logs, AWS WAF logs, and application logs.
    - 2. Deploy a centralized log management solution, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs
      or a third-party solution like Splunk or Sumo Logic, to collect and aggregate
      logs from different sources.
    - 3. Configure security monitoring tools or services, such as Amazon GuardDuty,
      AWS Security Hub, or third-party SIEM solutions, to analyze the collected data
      and detect anomalies or suspicious patterns.
    - 4. Define rules, alerts, and notifications based on your organization's security
      policies and risk tolerance to be alerted on potential security incidents.
    - 5. Regularly review and update the monitoring rules and configurations to ensure
      they are effective and up-to-date with the latest threats and attack vectors.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to detect and alert on any suspicious or anomalous activities within an organization's
    systems and applications. It continuously monitors user behavior, system logs,
    network traffic, and other relevant data sources to identify potential security
    threats or unauthorized actions. This check is crucial for proactively identifying
    and responding to potential security incidents, such as unauthorized access attempts,
    data exfiltration, or malicious insider activities.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The system is not configured to monitor for suspicious activities across
      relevant data sources, leaving the organization vulnerable to potential security
      incidents.
    partial: The system is partially monitoring for suspicious activities, but some
      critical data sources are not being monitored, increasing the risk of undetected
      security incidents.
    success: The system is successfully monitoring for suspicious activities across
      all relevant data sources.
  reason: The provided AWS EC2Resource field paths do not contain any information
    related to monitoring user behavior, system logs, network traffic, or other data
    sources required for detecting suspicious activities. The EC2Resource primarily
    contains information about EC2 instances, networking components, and related resources,
    but does not provide the necessary data for implementing this security check.
