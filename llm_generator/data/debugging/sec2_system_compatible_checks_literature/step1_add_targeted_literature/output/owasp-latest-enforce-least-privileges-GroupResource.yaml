    description: To properly implement the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges'
      check, you would need to review and configure access controls and permissions
      for specific applications, systems, or resources used by the members of this
      group.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours initially, with ongoing maintenance
    instructions:
    - Identify the critical applications, systems, and resources accessed by members
      of this group.
    - Review the current access controls and permissions granted to group members
      for each of these resources.
    - Remove any excessive or unnecessary permissions, following the principle of
      least privilege.
    - Implement role-based access controls or other mechanisms to ensure members only
      have the minimum required permissions.
    - Regularly review and audit access privileges to maintain least privilege compliance.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check is focused on ensuring
    that applications and systems follow the principle of least privilege, which restricts
    access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only the permissions essential
    for their intended functions. This helps mitigate threats like privilege escalation,
    unauthorized data access, and malicious code execution.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not have appropriate least privilege controls
      in place, potentially allowing excessive permissions or unauthorized access.
    partial: Some aspects of the GroupResource follow least privilege principles,
      but additional configuration or controls may be needed.
    success: The GroupResource is configured to follow the principle of least privilege,
      with members granted only the necessary permissions for their roles.
  reason: The Google GroupResource represents a group of users or other entities,
    but it does not directly control or manage access privileges or permissions for
    specific applications or systems. While the group membership information and description
    could potentially be used as part of a broader least privilege implementation,
    the GroupResource itself does not enforce or configure least privilege settings.
