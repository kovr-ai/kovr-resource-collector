  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and observability service
    that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. It does not directly handle session management or authentication
    for web applications. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing
    the OWASP secure session management security check.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource does not handle session management or authentication
      for web applications.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource partially implements secure session management
      practices.
    success: The CloudWatch resource implements secure session management practices.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is a monitoring service and does not handle session
    management or authentication for web applications. The security check is focused
    on validating secure session management practices in web applications, which is
    not a functionality provided by CloudWatch.
