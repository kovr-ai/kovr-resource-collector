    description: To implement Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for web
      applications, you need to use a dedicated DAST tool or service that can actively
      test and analyze the running web application.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing effort for regular testing
    instructions:
    - Identify the web applications that need to be tested using DAST.
    - Research and select a suitable DAST tool or service that meets your requirements.
    - Configure and set up the DAST tool or service according to the vendor's documentation.
    - Define the scope and testing parameters for the DAST tool.
    - Schedule and run the DAST tests on the target web applications.
    - Review and address the identified vulnerabilities and findings from the DAST
      reports.

  literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related events
    for your account. It does not directly support conducting Dynamic Application
    Security Testing (DAST) on web applications. DAST involves actively testing a
    running web application by simulating real-world attacks and analyzing the application's
    behavior and responses. CloudTrail is primarily used for auditing and monitoring
    purposes, not for actively testing web applications.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource does not support conducting Dynamic Application
      Security Testing (DAST) on web applications.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource partially supports Dynamic Application Security
      Testing (DAST) on web applications.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to support Dynamic Application
      Security Testing (DAST) on web applications.
  reason: AWS CloudTrail is a service for logging and auditing AWS API calls and related
    events. It does not have functionality to conduct Dynamic Application Security
    Testing (DAST) on web applications, which is the focus of this security check.
    CloudTrail is not applicable for implementing this DAST security check.
