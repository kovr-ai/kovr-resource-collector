    description: To enable comprehensive logging for S3 buckets, server access logging
      must be configured for each bucket.
    estimated_time: 10-15 minutes per bucket
    instructions:
    - 1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    - 2. Select the bucket for which you want to enable logging.
    - 3. Go to the 'Properties' tab and click on 'Server access logging'.
    - 4. Enable logging and specify a target bucket and optional prefix for log file
      storage.
    - 5. Review and save the logging configuration.
    - 6. Repeat the process for all remaining S3 buckets.

  literature: AWS S3 buckets support comprehensive logging mechanisms that capture
    detailed information about access requests, object-level operations, and other
    bucket-related activities. By enabling S3 server access logging, organizations
    can maintain visibility into all requests made to their S3 buckets, including
    the requester, bucket name, request time, action, response status, and other relevant
    details. This logging data can be used for security monitoring, incident response,
    and forensic analysis, helping organizations meet compliance requirements and
    maintain accountability.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: S3 bucket logging is not enabled, which may hinder visibility into bucket
      activities and compromise security monitoring and incident response capabilities.
    partial: Some S3 buckets have logging enabled, while others do not. Consistent
      logging should be implemented across all buckets for comprehensive monitoring
      and auditing.
    success: S3 bucket logging is enabled, providing comprehensive logging mechanisms
      for monitoring and auditing purposes.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is valid for implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
    as it provides the necessary configuration options to enable and manage access
    logging for S3 buckets.
