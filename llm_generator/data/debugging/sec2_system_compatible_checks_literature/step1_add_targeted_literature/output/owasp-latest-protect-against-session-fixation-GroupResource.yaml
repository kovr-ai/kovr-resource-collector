  literature: The Google GroupResource represents a group within Google Workspace,
    which is used for managing access and permissions for various Google services
    and resources. This resource does not appear to be directly related to session
    management or protection against session fixation attacks. Session fixation is
    typically addressed at the application or service level, where user sessions are
    created, managed, and validated.
