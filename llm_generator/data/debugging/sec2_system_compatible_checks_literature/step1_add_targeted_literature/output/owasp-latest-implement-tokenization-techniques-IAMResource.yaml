    description: To implement tokenization techniques for protecting sensitive data
      in AWS, you need to consider other resources and services that handle data storage,
      processing, and transmission.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify the applications or services that handle sensitive data in your AWS
      environment.
    - Evaluate the available tokenization solutions, such as AWS Encryption SDK, AWS
      Key Management Service (KMS), or third-party tokenization services.
    - Implement tokenization at the application or data layer, replacing sensitive
      data with non-sensitive tokens before storing or transmitting the data.
    - Store the tokenized data in appropriate AWS resources, such as Amazon S3, Amazon
      RDS, or Amazon DynamoDB, depending on your requirements.
    - Securely store the token vault or token mapping database, ensuring proper access
      controls and encryption.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing tokenization
    techniques for protecting sensitive data. Tokenization is a data security technique
    that replaces sensitive data elements with non-sensitive placeholders called tokens,
    typically implemented at the application or data layer. The IAMResource represents
    Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, users, and access keys, which are
    used for controlling access to AWS resources, but do not directly handle tokenization
    of sensitive data.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource is not applicable for implementing tokenization techniques
      to protect sensitive data.
    partial: The IAMResource does not directly support tokenization techniques, but
      can be used in conjunction with other resources to implement data protection
      measures.
    success: The IAMResource is configured to support tokenization techniques for
      protecting sensitive data.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS is primarily used for managing access control and
    authentication, but does not directly handle tokenization of sensitive data. Tokenization
    is typically implemented at the application or data layer, and is not a core functionality
    of the IAMResource.
