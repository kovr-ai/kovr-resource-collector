    description: This security check is not applicable to the EC2Resource, as it is
      not a web application. To implement DAST, you need to identify and test the
      web applications running on your cloud infrastructure.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number and complexity
      of web applications, as well as the chosen DAST tool and its configuration.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the web applications running on your cloud infrastructure, either
      on EC2 instances or other services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, or
      AWS Fargate.
    - 2. Evaluate the available DAST tools and select the one that best fits your
      requirements and application architecture.
    - 3. Configure the DAST tool to scan and test the identified web applications
      for security vulnerabilities.
    - 4. Schedule regular DAST scans and review the results to identify and mitigate
      any vulnerabilities found.

  literature: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a technique used to identify
    security vulnerabilities in web applications by simulating real-world attacks
    and analyzing the application's behavior and responses. It involves interacting
    with the running application from the outside, mimicking the actions of a malicious
    user or attacker. DAST tools can detect vulnerabilities such as injection flaws,
    broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, XML external entities (XXE), and
    other security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The DAST security check is not applicable to the resource, as it is not
      a web application.
    partial: The DAST security check is not applicable to the resource, as it is not
      a web application.
    success: The DAST security check is applicable to the resource, and the web application
      has been successfully tested for vulnerabilities.
  reason: The provided resource 'EC2Resource' is an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
    resource, which represents virtual machines or instances running in the AWS cloud.
    This resource does not directly relate to web applications or application security
    testing. DAST is a technique specifically designed to test web applications for
    security vulnerabilities by simulating attacks against the running application.
    Therefore, the EC2Resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-conduct-dynamic-application-security-testing-(dast)'
    security check.
