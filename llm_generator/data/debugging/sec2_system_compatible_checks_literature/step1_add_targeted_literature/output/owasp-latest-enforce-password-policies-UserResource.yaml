    description: To implement the 'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies' security
      check, you need to identify and analyze the appropriate resources or services
      within Google Cloud Platform that handle authentication and password management.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Consult the Google Cloud Platform documentation to find resources or services
      related to identity and access management (IAM), user authentication, and password
      policies.
    - Analyze the relevant resources or services to determine if they provide the
      necessary fields or configuration options to enforce strong password policies.
    - If applicable resources or services are found, follow the specific implementation
      guidance provided by Google Cloud Platform to configure and enforce strong password
      policies.
    - If no suitable resources or services are found, consider implementing custom
      solutions or third-party tools to enforce password policies within your Google
      Cloud Platform environment.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' from Google Cloud Platform does
    not appear to be directly applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies'
    security check. This check is focused on validating the existence and enforcement
    of strong password policies within an organization or system, which typically
    includes requirements such as minimum password length, complexity rules, password
    expiration periods, and restrictions on password reuse. The UserResource, based
    on the provided field paths, seems to be a representation of user information
    and account details, but does not contain any specific fields related to password
    policies or authentication mechanisms.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The system does not enforce strong password policies, leaving it vulnerable
      to password-related attacks and unauthorized access.
    partial: N/A
    success: The system enforces strong password policies in accordance with industry
      best practices and regulatory requirements.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any fields related to password policies
    or authentication mechanisms, which are essential for implementing the 'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies'
    security check.
