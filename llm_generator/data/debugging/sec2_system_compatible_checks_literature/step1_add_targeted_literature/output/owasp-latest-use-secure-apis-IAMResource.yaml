  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check is focused on ensuring that applications
    use the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities
    introduced by outdated or insecure code. This check is primarily applicable to
    application code and the libraries/APIs used within that code.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application uses outdated or insecure versions of APIs and libraries,
      increasing the risk of vulnerabilities and potential security incidents.
    partial: Some APIs and libraries used by the application are outdated or insecure,
      while others are up-to-date and secure.
    success: The application uses the latest, secure versions of all APIs and libraries,
      minimizing the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by outdated or insecure code.
  reason: The provided AWS IAMResource does not contain any information related to
    the application code or the libraries/APIs used within that code. This resource
    is focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, users, and access
    keys, which are not directly relevant to the OWASP latest use secure APIs check.
