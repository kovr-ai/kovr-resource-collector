    description: If IAM policies are not regularly reviewed and updated, they may
      become outdated and introduce security risks. Remediation involves establishing
      a process for periodic policy reviews and updates.
    estimated_time: The time required for remediation will vary based on the number
      of policies and the complexity of the organization's environment. A comprehensive
      review and update process may take several weeks or months.
    instructions:
    - Identify all IAM policies and their last review/update dates.
    - Prioritize policies based on their criticality and potential impact.
    - Review each policy to ensure it aligns with the organization's security requirements
      and best practices.
    - Update policies as needed, following the principle of least privilege and incorporating
      any necessary changes.
    - Establish a recurring schedule for regular policy reviews and updates (e.g.,
      quarterly, annually).
    - Document and communicate policy changes to relevant stakeholders.

  literature: The IAM (Identity and Access Management) resource in AWS is relevant
    for implementing the security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-policies'.
    IAM policies define permissions and access controls for AWS resources, making
    them a crucial component of an organization's overall security posture. Regular
    review and updates of these policies are essential to ensure that access privileges
    align with the principle of least privilege and reflect changes in organizational
    requirements, personnel, and security best practices.

      and best practices.
    success: IAM policies are regularly reviewed and updated to align with the organization's
      security requirements and best practices.

    and update dates, and the policy document details, including the actions, resources,
    and effects defined in the policy statements. These fields are crucial for reviewing
    and updating security policies to ensure they align with the organization's security
    requirements and best practices.
