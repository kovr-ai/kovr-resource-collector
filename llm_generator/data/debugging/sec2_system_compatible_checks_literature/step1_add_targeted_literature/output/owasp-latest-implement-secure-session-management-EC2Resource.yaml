    automation_available: false
    description: This security check is not applicable to the EC2Resource. To implement
      secure session management, you need to review and configure your web applications
      and their underlying infrastructure components.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the number of web applications and complexity
      of the infrastructure
    instructions:
    - Identify the web applications running on your infrastructure
    - Review the session management implementation of each web application
    - Implement secure session management practices as per industry standards (e.g.,
      OWASP guidelines)
    - Configure web servers, load balancers, and other infrastructure components to
      support secure session management
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing secure
    session management for web applications. Secure session management involves protecting
    user sessions from unauthorized access, hijacking, and other attacks by generating
    unpredictable session identifiers, protecting session data from tampering, setting
    appropriate session timeouts, and invalidating sessions after logout or inactivity.
    This security check is primarily applicable to web applications and their underlying
    infrastructure, rather than EC2 instances or other cloud resources.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource does not implement secure session management practices
      for web applications.
    partial: The EC2 resource partially implements secure session management practices
      for web applications.
    success: The EC2 resource implements secure session management practices for web
      applications.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any information or configurations related
    to web application session management. This security check is not applicable to
    this resource.
