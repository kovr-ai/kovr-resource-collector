  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-deserialization-mechanisms'
    is focused on ensuring that applications use secure deserialization mechanisms
    to prevent code execution and data tampering attacks. However, the provided resource
    'GroupResource' from Google Cloud Platform appears to be related to managing Google
    Groups, which are user collections for collaboration and access control. This
    resource does not seem to have any direct relation to application deserialization
    mechanisms.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use secure deserialization mechanisms, leaving
      it vulnerable to code execution and data tampering attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses secure deserialization mechanisms to prevent code
      execution and data tampering attacks.
  reason: The GroupResource is a management interface for Google Groups, which are
    user collections used for collaboration and access control. It does not appear
    to be directly related to application deserialization mechanisms, which is the
    focus of the security check.
