  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
    is related to preventing XML External Entity (XXE) attacks by disabling external
    entity processing in applications that parse XML input. This check is primarily
    applicable to web applications, application servers, or services that handle XML
    data. The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly handle XML processing or provide
    configurations related to XML parsing. Therefore, this resource is not directly
    applicable for implementing this security check.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
      security check.
  reason: The EC2Resource in AWS represents Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances,
    networking components, and related resources. It does not have any direct configuration
    or settings related to XML parsing or external entity processing. This security
    check is more relevant for web applications, application servers, or services
    that handle XML data.
