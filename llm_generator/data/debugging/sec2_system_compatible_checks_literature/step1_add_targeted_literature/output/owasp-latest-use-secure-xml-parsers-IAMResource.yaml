  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' is focused
    on ensuring that secure XML parsers are used when processing XML data to mitigate
    risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML Injection, and Denial of
    Service (DoS) attacks. However, the provided AWS IAMResource does not appear to
    be directly related to XML parsing or handling XML data. The IAMResource represents
    Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources such as users, policies, and access
    keys, which are used for managing access and permissions within an AWS account.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS IAMResource is not configured to use secure XML parsers when
      handling XML data.
    partial: The AWS IAMResource partially meets the requirements for using secure
      XML parsers when handling XML data.
    success: The AWS IAMResource is configured to use secure XML parsers when handling
      XML data.
  reason: The AWS IAMResource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers'
    security check as it does not handle XML data or XML parsing. This resource is
    focused on managing access and permissions within an AWS account, which is not
    directly related to the security check.
