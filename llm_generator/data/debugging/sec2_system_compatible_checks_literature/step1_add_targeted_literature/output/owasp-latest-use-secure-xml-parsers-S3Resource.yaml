    description: No fix is required as this security check is not applicable to AWS
      S3 buckets.
    estimated_time: N/A

  is_valid: false
  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' is focused
    on ensuring that secure XML parsers are used when processing XML data to mitigate
    risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML Injection, and Denial of
    Service (DoS) attacks. However, the provided resource 'S3Resource' is an AWS S3
    bucket, which is a storage service for storing and retrieving data. S3 buckets
    do not directly handle XML parsing or processing, and therefore this security
    check is not applicable to this resource.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 buckets.
    partial: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 buckets.
    success: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 buckets.
  reason: The AWS S3 bucket resource does not involve XML parsing or processing, which
    is the focus of the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' security check. S3 buckets
    are used for data storage and retrieval, and do not directly handle XML data or
    use XML parsers.
