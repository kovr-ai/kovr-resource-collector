    description: This security check is not applicable to the IAMResource in AWS.
      Password hashing and authentication should be implemented within the application
      or service that requires user authentication.
    estimated_time: N/A
    instructions: []
  is_valid: false
  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly handle password hashing or
    authentication mechanisms. It is primarily used for managing AWS Identity and
    Access Management (IAM) entities such as users, groups, roles, and policies. Password
    hashing and authentication are typically handled by the application or service
    that requires user authentication, not by the IAM resource itself.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource is not applicable for implementing password hashing.
    partial: The IAMResource is not applicable for implementing password hashing.
    success: The IAMResource is not applicable for implementing password hashing.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS is not responsible for implementing password hashing
    or authentication mechanisms. It is used for managing IAM entities and their permissions,
    but does not handle the actual authentication process or password storage.
