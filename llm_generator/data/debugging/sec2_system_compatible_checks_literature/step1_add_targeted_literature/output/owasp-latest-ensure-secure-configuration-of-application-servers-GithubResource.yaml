    description: If any application servers are found to have insecure configurations,
      they need to be hardened and updated to follow security best practices.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours per server, depending on the complexity of the application
      and the number of insecure configurations found.
    instructions:
    - Identify the application servers hosting the code in the repositories.
    - Review the server configurations and settings against industry-standard hardening
      guidelines.
    - Update any insecure configurations, such as disabling unnecessary services,
      restricting access, enabling secure protocols, and applying the latest security
      patches.
    - Implement continuous monitoring and automated configuration management to ensure
      servers remain securely configured over time.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-application-servers'
    is focused on ensuring that application servers are configured securely to prevent
    unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents. However, the
    provided resource 'GithubResource' appears to be related to GitHub repositories
    and their associated data, such as branches, collaborators, security advisories,
    and vulnerability alerts. While GitHub repositories may contain application code,
    the resource itself does not seem to provide direct access or configuration details
    for the underlying application servers hosting the code.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more application servers have insecure configurations, which could
      lead to vulnerabilities such as unintended data exposure, remote code execution,
      and privilege escalation.
    partial: Some application servers have secure configurations, but others may have
      insecure settings that need to be addressed.
    success: The application servers are configured securely, following industry best
      practices and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The GithubResource does not contain information about the configuration
    or settings of the application servers hosting the code in the repositories. It
    primarily provides metadata, statistics, and security-related data about the repositories
    themselves, but not the servers running the applications.
