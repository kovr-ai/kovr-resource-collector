  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check is focused on ensuring that applications
    use the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities
    introduced by outdated or insecure code. This check is primarily applicable to
    application code and the libraries/APIs used within the application codebase.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application is using outdated or insecure versions of APIs or libraries,
      which introduces potential vulnerabilities.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The application is using the latest, secure versions of all APIs and
      libraries.
  reason: The provided resource 'GroupResource' from Google Cloud Platform appears
    to be related to managing groups and group memberships within an organization.
    This resource does not seem to be directly related to application code or the
    APIs/libraries used within an application. Therefore, this resource is not applicable
    for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-apis' security check.
