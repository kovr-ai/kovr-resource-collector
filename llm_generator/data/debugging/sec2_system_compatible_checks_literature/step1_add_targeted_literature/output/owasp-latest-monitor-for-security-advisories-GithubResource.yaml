    description: To implement this security check, you would need to integrate with
      external services or tools that provide security advisory monitoring capabilities.
      This could involve subscribing to security advisory feeds, setting up notifications,
      or using third-party security monitoring solutions.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing effort for monitoring
    instructions:
    - Identify reputable sources for security advisories relevant to the software
      and technologies used in your environment.
    - Subscribe to security advisory mailing lists or RSS feeds from these sources.
    - Implement a process for regularly checking and reviewing these advisory sources.
    - Consider using a centralized security advisory monitoring tool or service to
      streamline the process.

  literature: The provided resource is a GitHub repository, which does not directly
    relate to monitoring for security advisories. Security advisories are typically
    issued by software vendors, security researchers, or organizations to inform users
    about vulnerabilities or security flaws in their products or services. While GitHub
    repositories may contain code or software that could be affected by security advisories,
    the repository itself does not provide functionality for monitoring or receiving
    security advisories.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource does not have the capability to monitor for security advisories.
    partial: The resource partially supports monitoring for security advisories, but
      additional steps or configurations are required.
    success: The resource is capable of monitoring for security advisories and taking
      appropriate actions.
  reason: The GitHub repository resource does not contain any information or functionality
    related to monitoring for security advisories. It primarily contains data about
    the repository itself, such as its code, branches, collaborators, and security
    settings, but does not provide a mechanism for actively monitoring or receiving
    security advisories from external sources.
