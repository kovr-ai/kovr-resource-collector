    description: To address this security check, a thorough review of the applications
      and systems running on the EC2 instances should be conducted. Unnecessary features,
      components, or functionality that are not required for the intended operation
      should be identified and removed or disabled.
    estimated_time: The estimated time can vary significantly depending on the number
      and complexity of applications and systems involved. It could range from a few
      hours for simple applications to several weeks or months for complex, enterprise-level
      systems.
    instructions:
    - Inventory all applications and systems running on the EC2 instances.
    - Analyze each application or system to identify unnecessary features, components,
      or functionality.
    - Consult with application owners, developers, and security teams to determine
      which features or components can be safely removed or disabled.
    - Implement the necessary changes to remove or disable the identified unnecessary
      elements.
    - Validate and test the changes to ensure the intended functionality is not impacted.
    - Monitor and maintain the applications and systems to prevent the reintroduction
      of unnecessary features or components.

  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'
    aims to ensure that applications and systems do not expose unnecessary features,
    components, or functionality that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
    However, the provided resource 'EC2Resource' appears to be related to AWS Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, networking components, and associated resources.
    This resource does not directly address the removal or disabling of unnecessary
    features or components within applications or systems.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application or system exposes unnecessary features or components
      that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
    partial: Some unnecessary features or components have been identified and should
      be removed or disabled to improve the security posture.
    success: The application or system does not expose any unnecessary features or
      components that could be exploited by attackers.
  reason: The EC2Resource is focused on managing and configuring EC2 instances, networking
    components, and related resources. It does not provide direct mechanisms for identifying
    or removing unnecessary features or components within applications or systems
    running on those instances. This security check is more applicable to application-level
    resources or configurations.
