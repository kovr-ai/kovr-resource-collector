    description: To implement tokenization techniques, you need to identify the applications
      or data stores that handle sensitive data and apply tokenization at those levels.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of your environment and the
      tokenization solution chosen.
    instructions:
    - Identify the applications or data stores that process or store sensitive data,
      such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or personally identifiable
      information (PII).
    - Evaluate and select a tokenization solution that meets your organization's security
      and compliance requirements.
    - Implement the tokenization solution by replacing sensitive data elements with
      non-sensitive tokens before storing or transmitting the data.
    - Store the original sensitive data in a secure token vault or encrypted data
      store.
    - Update applications and systems to use the tokenized data instead of the original
      sensitive data.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to implementing tokenization techniques for protecting sensitive data. This resource
    represents a group of users or entities within an organization, and its fields
    contain information about the group's metadata, membership details, and source
    connector. Tokenization is typically implemented at the application or data storage
    level to replace sensitive data elements with non-sensitive placeholders.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not implement tokenization techniques to protect
      sensitive data.
    partial: The GroupResource partially implements tokenization techniques, but additional
      measures are required to fully protect sensitive data.
    success: The GroupResource implements tokenization techniques to protect sensitive
      data at rest and in transit.
  reason: The GroupResource does not contain any fields or functionality related to
    tokenization or handling sensitive data. It is primarily used for managing user
    groups and their membership information within an organization.
