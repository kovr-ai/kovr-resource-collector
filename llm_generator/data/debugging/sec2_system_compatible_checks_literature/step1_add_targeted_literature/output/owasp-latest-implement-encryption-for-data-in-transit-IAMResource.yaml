    description: To implement encryption for data in transit, you need to configure
      encryption settings at the service level (e.g., ELB, RDS, S3) or implement network-level
      encryption mechanisms like VPNs or SSL/TLS.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the AWS services that handle sensitive data transmissions in your environment.
    - Review the encryption settings for each relevant service and ensure that encryption
      for data in transit is enabled and configured properly.
    - If using VPNs or SSL/TLS for network-level encryption, ensure that the configurations
      are up-to-date and follow best practices.
    - Review and update IAM policies to enforce encryption requirements for relevant
      services and resources.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS primarily deals with Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) policies, user accounts, and access keys. While IAM policies can include
    statements related to encryption requirements for certain AWS services, the IAM
    Resource itself does not directly implement encryption for data in transit. Encryption
    for data in transit is typically handled at the service level (e.g., ELB, RDS,
    S3) or through network-level encryption mechanisms like VPNs or SSL/TLS.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM Resource does not have policies that enforce encryption for data
      in transit across relevant AWS services.
    partial: The IAM Resource has some policies that enforce encryption for data in
      transit, but not for all relevant AWS services.
    success: The IAM Resource has policies that enforce encryption for data in transit
      across all relevant AWS services.
  reason: The IAM Resource does not directly handle encryption for data in transit.
    It primarily manages IAM policies, user accounts, and access keys, which are not
    directly related to implementing encryption for data transmissions.
