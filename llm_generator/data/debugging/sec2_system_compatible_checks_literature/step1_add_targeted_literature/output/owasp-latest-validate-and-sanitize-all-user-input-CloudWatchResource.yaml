  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It does not directly handle user input or perform input validation
    and sanitization. Therefore, this resource is not directly applicable for implementing
    the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input' security check.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and logging service that does not
    directly handle user input or perform input validation and sanitization. This
    security check is focused on ensuring that all user input is properly validated
    and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities,
    which is not a primary function of the CloudWatch resource.
