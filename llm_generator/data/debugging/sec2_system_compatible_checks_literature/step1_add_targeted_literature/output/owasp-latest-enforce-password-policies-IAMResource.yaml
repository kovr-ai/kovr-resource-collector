    description: If the IAM password policies are found to be inadequate or missing,
      they need to be updated or created to enforce strong password requirements.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - Review the existing IAM password policies and identify any missing or weak requirements.
    - Update the policies to include strong password complexity rules, minimum length,
      expiration periods, and restrictions on password reuse.
    - Apply the updated policies to all IAM users and groups within the AWS account.
    - Monitor and enforce compliance with the updated password policies on an ongoing
      basis.
  is_valid: true
  literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing the owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies
    security check. This resource contains information about IAM users and their associated
    password policies. By analyzing the policies attached to IAM users and the policy
    statements within those policies, it is possible to validate if strong password
    requirements are enforced.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM password policies do not enforce strong password requirements,
      leaving the system vulnerable to weak or easily guessable passwords.
    partial: The IAM password policies partially enforce strong password requirements,
      but some critical aspects are missing or not properly configured.
    success: The IAM password policies enforce strong password requirements, including
      minimum length, complexity rules, expiration periods, and restrictions on password
      reuse.
  reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM user details, including their access
    keys and associated policies. By inspecting the policy statements and conditions,
    it is possible to determine if password complexity, expiration, and reuse requirements
    are enforced.
