    description: To implement secure authentication mechanisms, the application code
      and configurations need to be reviewed and updated.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Implement brute-force protection mechanisms, such as account lockout policies
      or CAPTCHA challenges after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    - Implement credential stuffing protection mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication,
      IP address monitoring, and user behavior analytics.
    - Implement secure session management practices, such as generating new session
      IDs after successful authentication, setting secure cookie flags, and implementing
      session timeouts and logout functionality.
    - Regularly review and update authentication mechanisms to address new threats
      and vulnerabilities.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP latest secure authentication mechanisms check focuses on validating
    the implementation of secure authentication mechanisms within an application to
    protect against common authentication attacks. This includes measures such as
    brute-force protection, credential stuffing prevention, and session management
    to mitigate session hijacking risks. The UserResource provided appears to be a
    user account resource within the Google Cloud Platform, containing user profile
    information, contact details, and security settings.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure authentication mechanisms,
      leaving it vulnerable to common authentication attacks.
    partial: The application partially implements secure authentication mechanisms,
      but some vulnerabilities may still exist.
    success: The application implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect
      against common attacks like brute-force, credential stuffing, and session hijacking.
  reason: While the UserResource contains some security-related fields like two-step
    verification enrollment status, it does not provide sufficient information or
    controls to implement secure authentication mechanisms within an application.
    This resource represents user account data rather than application authentication
    logic or configurations.
