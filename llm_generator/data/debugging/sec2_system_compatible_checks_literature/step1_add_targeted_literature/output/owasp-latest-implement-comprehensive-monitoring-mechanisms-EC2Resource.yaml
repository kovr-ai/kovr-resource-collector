    description: To implement comprehensive monitoring mechanisms in AWS, multiple
      services and resources need to be configured and integrated.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance required
    instructions:
    - 1. Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture API activity logs across all AWS services
      and regions.
    - 2. Configure CloudWatch to collect and analyze logs from various AWS services
      and applications.
    - 3. Deploy AWS GuardDuty to continuously monitor for malicious activity and unauthorized
      behavior.
    - 4. Integrate AWS Security Hub to centralize security findings and recommendations
      from multiple AWS services.
    - 5. Configure appropriate alerting and notification mechanisms for detected security
      events.
    - 6. Regularly review and analyze monitoring data to identify potential security
      incidents and unauthorized access attempts.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS provides information about various EC2 components
    such as instances, security groups, and network interfaces. However, it does not
    directly provide comprehensive monitoring mechanisms or logging capabilities for
    detecting security incidents and unauthorized access attempts across the entire
    AWS infrastructure and applications.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS account does not have comprehensive monitoring mechanisms in
      place to detect security incidents and unauthorized access attempts across the
      infrastructure and applications.
    partial: The AWS account has implemented some monitoring mechanisms, but they
      are not comprehensive and may not cover all aspects of the infrastructure and
      applications.
    success: The AWS account has implemented comprehensive monitoring mechanisms using
      services like CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and AWS Security Hub to detect
      security incidents and unauthorized access attempts across the infrastructure
      and applications.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain information related to monitoring and logging
    mechanisms. It primarily focuses on the configuration and state of EC2 resources
    within an AWS account. To implement comprehensive monitoring, other AWS services
    and resources need to be leveraged, such as CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty,
    and AWS Security Hub.
