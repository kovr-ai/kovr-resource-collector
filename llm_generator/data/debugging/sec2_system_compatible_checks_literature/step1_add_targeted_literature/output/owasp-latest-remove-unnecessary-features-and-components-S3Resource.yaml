    description: Review and adjust the S3 bucket configurations to remove or disable
      unnecessary features and components.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes
    instructions:
    - 1. Review the public access settings (public_access_block) and ensure that public
      access is blocked or restricted as per your requirements.
    - 2. Disable website hosting (website_enabled) if it is not required for the bucket.
    - 3. Review and remove any unnecessary bucket policies or access control lists
      (ACLs) that grant excessive permissions.
    - 4. Consider enabling versioning and object locking to protect against accidental
      or malicious data deletion or modification.
