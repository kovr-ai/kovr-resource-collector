    description: 'If the UserResource is not configured with proper access control
      mechanisms, the following steps can be taken to remediate the issue:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review and configure the admin_info fields to define appropriate administrative
      roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication for all user accounts by configuring
      the security_info fields.
    - Organize user accounts into appropriate organizational units (orgUnitPath) and
      apply access control policies based on the hierarchical structure.
    - Regularly review and audit user access privileges to ensure they align with
      the organization's security policies and access control requirements.

  literature: The Google UserResource contains information related to user accounts
    and their access privileges within the Google Workspace environment. Proper access
    control mechanisms can be implemented by leveraging the admin_info fields to define
    administrative roles and permissions, as well as the security_info fields to enforce
    multi-factor authentication requirements. Additionally, the organizational_info.orgUnitPath
    field can be used to structure organizational units and apply access control policies
    based on the hierarchical structure.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource is not configured with proper access control mechanisms,
      leaving the system vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential security
      breaches.
    partial: The UserResource has some access control mechanisms in place, but additional
      configurations or improvements are required to fully implement proper access
      control.
    success: The UserResource is configured with appropriate access control mechanisms,
      including administrative roles, multi-factor authentication enforcement, and
      organizational unit structure.
  reason: The UserResource provides fields and attributes that can be used to implement
    role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce multi-factor authentication requirements,
    which are essential components of proper access control mechanisms.
