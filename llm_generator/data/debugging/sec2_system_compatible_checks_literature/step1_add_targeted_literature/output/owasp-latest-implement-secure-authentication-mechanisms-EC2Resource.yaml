    unique_id: owasp-latest-implement-secure-authentication-mechanisms
  field_paths: []
  fix_details:
    automation_available: false
    description: To address this security check, you need to review and potentially
      update the authentication mechanisms implemented within the application code
      or configuration.
    estimated_time: Highly variable, depending on the complexity of the application
      and the extent of changes required.
    instructions:
    - Identify the authentication mechanisms currently used by the application (e.g.,
      password-based, multi-factor, federated, etc.)
    - Evaluate the security of these mechanisms against industry best practices and
      guidelines (e.g., OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet)
    - Implement necessary updates or replacements to strengthen the authentication
      mechanisms, such as using strong password policies, multi-factor authentication,
      secure session management, and protection against common attacks like brute-force
      and credential stuffing.
    - Test and validate the updated authentication mechanisms to ensure they are functioning
      as intended and providing the desired level of security.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2 resource in AWS provides details about Elastic Compute Cloud
    (EC2) instances, security groups, network interfaces, and other related resources.
    However, it does not directly provide information about authentication mechanisms
    implemented within applications running on those instances. The authentication
    mechanisms are typically implemented within the application code or configuration.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure authentication mechanisms,
      leaving it vulnerable to common authentication attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect
      against common attacks such as brute-force, credential stuffing, and session
      hijacking.
  reason: The EC2 resource does not contain information relevant to implementing secure
    authentication mechanisms within applications. This security check is focused
    on validating the authentication mechanisms used by the application itself, rather
    than the underlying infrastructure resources.
