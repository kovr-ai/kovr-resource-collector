    description: If CloudTrail is not configured correctly, organizations may not
      be able to effectively monitor and audit access to sensitive data and resources,
      potentially leading to violations of data protection regulations and industry
      standards.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the existing CloudTrail trail configurations and ensure that appropriate
      event selectors and data resource types are defined to capture events related
      to data access, modification, and transfer.
    - Enable logging for the CloudTrail trails and configure them to deliver log files
      to a secure and centralized location, such as an S3 bucket.
    - Implement log monitoring and analysis processes to identify and investigate
      potential violations of data protection regulations and industry standards.
    - Regularly review and update the CloudTrail configurations to ensure they align
      with the latest data protection regulations and industry best practices.

  literature: The CloudTrailResource in AWS is relevant for implementing the 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations'
    security check. CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
    events, which can be used to monitor and audit access to sensitive data and resources.
    By configuring CloudTrail trails with appropriate event selectors and data resource
    types, organizations can capture and analyze events related to data access, modification,
    and transfer, helping them identify potential violations of data protection regulations
    and industry standards.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to capture and log events related to data
      access, modification, and transfer, hindering the ability to monitor and audit
      compliance with data protection regulations.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to capture and log events related
      to data access, modification, and transfer, but additional configuration may
      be required to ensure comprehensive monitoring and auditing of compliance with
      data protection regulations.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to capture and log events related to data access,
      modification, and transfer, enabling effective monitoring and auditing of compliance
      with data protection regulations.
  reason: The CloudTrailResource in AWS provides the necessary configuration options
    to capture and log events related to data access, modification, and transfer,
    which is essential for monitoring and auditing compliance with data protection
    regulations. By configuring appropriate event selectors, data resource types,
    and logging settings, organizations can ensure that relevant events are captured
    and analyzed for potential violations.
