    description: To address XSS vulnerabilities, web applications running on the EC2
      instances need to implement input validation and sanitization measures.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number and complexity
      of web applications running on the EC2 instances.
    instructions:
    - Identify all web applications running on the EC2 instances.
    - Review the code of each web application to ensure that user input is properly
      sanitized and validated before being rendered or processed.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization measures, such as escaping user
      input, whitelisting allowed characters, and validating input against expected
      patterns.
    - Test the web applications thoroughly to ensure that XSS vulnerabilities have
      been mitigated.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly handle input validation or
    prevention of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS vulnerabilities typically
    occur in web applications and are mitigated by properly sanitizing and validating
    user input on the application layer. The EC2Resource represents Amazon Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, which are virtual servers that can host web applications,
    but do not inherently provide input validation capabilities.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 instances are running web applications without adequate input
      validation and XSS prevention measures, leaving them vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    partial: Some of the web applications running on the EC2 instances have implemented
      input validation and XSS prevention measures, while others have not.
    success: The EC2 instances are configured to run web applications with proper
      input validation and XSS prevention measures.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not have any direct relevance to implementing input
    validation or preventing XSS attacks. These security measures need to be implemented
    within the web applications running on the EC2 instances.
