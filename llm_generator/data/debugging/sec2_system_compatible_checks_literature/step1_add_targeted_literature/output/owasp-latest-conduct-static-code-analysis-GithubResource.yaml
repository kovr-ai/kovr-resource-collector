  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-conduct-static-code-analysis' is focused
    on ensuring that the latest version of the OWASP static code analysis tool is
    used to detect potential vulnerabilities, coding errors, and deviations from best
    practices in source code. This check is primarily applicable to resources that
    contain source code or are directly involved in the software development lifecycle
    (SDLC).
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The latest version of the OWASP static code analysis tool is not being
      used, or vulnerabilities/coding issues were detected in the source code.
    partial: N/A
    success: The latest version of the OWASP static code analysis tool is being used,
      and no vulnerabilities or coding issues were detected in the source code.
  reason: The provided resource 'GithubResource' from the 'github' provider appears
    to be a representation of a GitHub repository. While GitHub repositories can contain
    source code, the resource itself does not seem to contain any information about
    static code analysis or the OWASP tool being used. Therefore, this resource is
    not directly applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-conduct-static-code-analysis'
    security check.
