    description: While the GroupResource can be used to manage group membership, proper
      access control mechanisms should be implemented at the resource level.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the resources that the group has access to and ensure that appropriate
      access control mechanisms are in place, such as IAM policies or ACLs.
    - Implement least privilege principles by granting only the necessary permissions
      to the group members.
    - Regularly review and audit group membership and access permissions to ensure
      they are up-to-date and aligned with business requirements.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a collection of
    entities, such as users or service accounts, that can be granted access to other
    resources. While groups can be used to manage access control, they do not directly
    implement access control mechanisms themselves. Proper access control mechanisms
    should be implemented at the resource level, such as IAM policies, access control
    lists (ACLs), or other resource-specific access control configurations.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource is not being used to implement proper access control
      mechanisms. Access control should be configured at the resource level using
      IAM policies, ACLs, or other resource-specific access control configurations.
    partial: The GroupResource is being used to manage group membership, but proper
      access control mechanisms may not be fully implemented at the resource level.
    success: The GroupResource is being used effectively to manage group membership,
      and proper access control mechanisms are implemented at the resource level.
  reason: The GroupResource is a container for managing group membership, but it does
    not directly implement access control mechanisms. Access control should be configured
    at the resource level, such as IAM policies or ACLs.
