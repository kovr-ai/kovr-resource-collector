    description: To implement DAST for web applications, you need to use specialized
      DAST tools and integrate them into your application security testing process.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify and select a suitable DAST tool that meets your requirements and supports
      your web application stack.
    - Configure the DAST tool to target your web application and define the testing
      scope and parameters.
    - Integrate the DAST tool into your continuous integration/continuous deployment
      (CI/CD) pipeline or schedule regular testing intervals.
    - Review and analyze the DAST reports to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities
      found.
    - Continuously monitor and update the DAST tool and testing process to ensure
      comprehensive coverage and alignment with the latest security best practices.

  literature: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a technique used to identify
    security vulnerabilities in web applications by simulating real-world attacks
    and analyzing the application's behavior and responses. It involves actively interacting
    with the running application from the outside, mimicking the actions of a malicious
    user or attacker. The CloudWatch resource provided is a monitoring and observability
    service that collects and manages log data, metrics, and alarms. It does not directly
    relate to conducting DAST on web applications.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource is not suitable for conducting DAST on web applications.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource does not directly support DAST, but it can be
      used to monitor and log the results of DAST activities.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to support DAST for web applications.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is not applicable for implementing the OWASP DAST
    security check. CloudWatch is a monitoring service and does not have the capability
    to perform dynamic security testing on web applications. DAST requires specialized
    tools and techniques to simulate attacks and analyze the application's responses.
