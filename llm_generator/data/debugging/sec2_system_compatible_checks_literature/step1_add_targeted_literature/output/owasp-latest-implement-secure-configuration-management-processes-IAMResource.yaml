    description: If issues are found with IAM configuration management processes,
      organizations should implement robust change control procedures, including tracking,
      testing, approving, and deploying changes in a controlled manner.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Establish a formal change management process for IAM policies, user access keys,
      and MFA device configurations.
    - Implement version control and audit logging for IAM policy changes.
    - Regularly review and rotate user access keys, and enforce MFA for privileged
      accounts.
    - Conduct periodic access reviews and remove unnecessary permissions or inactive
      accounts.
    - Automate the deployment of approved IAM configuration changes using secure pipelines.

  literature: The AWS IAM resource is applicable for implementing secure configuration
    management processes. IAM policies define permissions for AWS resources and services,
    and managing these policies through a secure change control process is crucial
    for maintaining system integrity and security. By reviewing IAM policy configurations,
    changes, and access, organizations can ensure that only authorized and intended
    modifications are made, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities or granting
    excessive permissions.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM policies, user access keys, and MFA device configurations are not
      being managed through secure configuration management processes, increasing
      the risk of unauthorized or unintended changes.
    partial: Some aspects of IAM policies, user access keys, and MFA device configurations
      are being managed through secure configuration management processes, but improvements
      are needed to fully comply with security best practices.
    success: IAM policies, user access keys, and MFA device configurations are being
      managed through secure configuration management processes.
  reason: The IAM resource provides visibility into IAM policies, user access keys,
    and MFA device configurations, which are essential components of secure configuration
    management processes. By monitoring and controlling changes to these elements,
    organizations can maintain the integrity of their AWS environment and ensure compliance
    with security best practices.
