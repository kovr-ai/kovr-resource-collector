    description: If comprehensive logging mechanisms for the UserResource are not
      implemented or are only partially implemented, additional configuration steps
      may be required.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the existing logging mechanisms and identify any gaps in capturing user
      activities, account modifications, and security-related events.
    - Configure logging for the relevant field paths, such as basic_info.creationTime,
      basic_info.lastLoginTime, contact_info.emails, contact_info.phones, security_info.isEnforcedIn2Sv,
      and security_info.isEnrolledIn2Sv.
    - Ensure that logs are securely stored, regularly reviewed, and integrated with
      security monitoring and incident response processes.

  literature: The Google UserResource contains information related to user accounts
    and their associated details. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms for
    this resource can help track user activities, detect potential security incidents,
    and enable effective incident response and forensic analysis. Relevant logging
    mechanisms may include capturing user login attempts, password changes, account
    modifications, and other security-related events.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Comprehensive logging mechanisms for the UserResource have not been implemented,
      leaving user activities and account modifications untracked, which increases
      the risk of undetected security incidents.
    partial: Partial logging mechanisms for the UserResource have been implemented,
      but some critical user activities or account modifications may not be captured,
      potentially leaving security gaps.
    success: Comprehensive logging mechanisms for the UserResource have been implemented
      successfully, capturing user activities, account modifications, and security-related
      events.
  reason: The UserResource contains critical user account information and security
    settings. Logging changes to these fields can provide visibility into user activities,
    account modifications, and security-related events, which aligns with the security
    check's objective of implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms.
