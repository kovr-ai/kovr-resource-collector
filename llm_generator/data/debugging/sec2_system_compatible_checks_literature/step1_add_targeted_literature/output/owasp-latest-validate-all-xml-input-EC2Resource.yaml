  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check is designed
    to validate all XML input received by an application to prevent various types
    of XML-based attacks. This check is primarily applicable to web applications,
    APIs, or services that accept XML input from users or external sources. The EC2Resource
    in AWS does not directly handle XML input or process XML data. It represents Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, networking resources, and related configurations.
    Therefore, this resource is not directly relevant for implementing this specific
    security check.

  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to the EC2Resource.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the EC2Resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the EC2Resource.
  reason: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly handle XML input or process XML
    data. It represents Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, networking resources,
    and related configurations, which are not directly relevant for validating XML
    input.
