    description: This check is not applicable to the AWS CloudTrail resource. However,
      if you need to ensure that your applications use the latest, secure versions
      of APIs and libraries, you should implement a process to regularly review and
      update the dependencies used in your application codebase.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the size and complexity
      of your application codebase, as well as the number of APIs and libraries used.
    instructions:
    - Identify all APIs and libraries used in your application codebase.
    - Check for the latest versions of these APIs and libraries, and review their
      security advisories for any known vulnerabilities.
    - Update your application codebase to use the latest, secure versions of APIs
      and libraries.
    - Implement a process to regularly monitor for new versions and security updates,
      and update your application codebase accordingly.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check is focused on ensuring that applications
    use the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities
    introduced by outdated or insecure code. This check is primarily applicable to
    application code and the libraries/APIs used within the application codebase.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application uses outdated or insecure versions of APIs and libraries,
      increasing the risk of vulnerabilities and potential security incidents.
    partial: Some components of the application use outdated or insecure versions
      of APIs and libraries, while others are up-to-date and secure.
    success: The application uses the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries,
      reducing the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by outdated or insecure code.
  reason: The AWS CloudTrail resource is a service that records AWS API calls and
    related events for your account. It does not directly relate to the use of secure
    APIs and libraries within application code. While CloudTrail can be used to monitor
    and audit API activity, it does not provide information about the specific versions
    of APIs or libraries used by applications.
