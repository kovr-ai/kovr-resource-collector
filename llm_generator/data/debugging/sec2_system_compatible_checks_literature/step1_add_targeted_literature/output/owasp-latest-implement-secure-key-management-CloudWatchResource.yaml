    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing secure key management
      practices. To address this security check, you should review and configure other
      AWS services that handle key management and encryption operations, such as AWS
      Key Management Service (KMS) and AWS Certificate Manager.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the AWS KMS documentation and best practices for secure key management.
    - Configure AWS KMS to generate, store, and rotate encryption keys securely.
    - Implement appropriate access controls and auditing for key management operations.
    - Use AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch to monitor and log key management events.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and logging
    purposes, and does not directly handle key management or encryption operations.
    While CloudWatch can be used to monitor and log events related to key management
    services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS), it does not implement secure key
    management practices itself.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-key-management'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-key-management'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-key-management'
      security check.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is not directly responsible for implementing secure
    key management practices. It is a monitoring and logging service that can be used
    to monitor and log events related to key management services, but it does not
    handle key generation, storage, rotation, or distribution.
