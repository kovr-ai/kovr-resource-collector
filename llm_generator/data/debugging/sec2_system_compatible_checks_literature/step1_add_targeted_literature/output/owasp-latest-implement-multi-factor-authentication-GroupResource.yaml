    description: To implement multi-factor authentication in Google Cloud Platform,
      you need to configure it at the user account level or through organizational
      policies.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes
    instructions:
    - 1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console and go to the 'IAM & Admin' section.
    - 2. Under 'Security Settings', select 'Multi-factor authentication'.
    - 3. Configure the desired MFA settings, such as enforcing MFA for all users or
      specific groups.
    - 4. Optionally, you can also set up organizational policies to enforce MFA across
      your entire organization.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of users,
    which is primarily used for managing access control and permissions. While groups
    can be used to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) policies, this resource
    itself does not directly implement or configure MFA. MFA is typically configured
    at the user account level or through organizational policies.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not enforce multi-factor authentication for its
      members.
    partial: The GroupResource does not directly implement multi-factor authentication.
    success: The GroupResource is configured to enforce multi-factor authentication
      for all members.
  reason: The GroupResource does not contain any fields or properties related to configuring
    or enforcing multi-factor authentication. It is primarily used for managing group
    membership and access control, but the actual MFA settings are managed separately
    at the user account or organizational level.
