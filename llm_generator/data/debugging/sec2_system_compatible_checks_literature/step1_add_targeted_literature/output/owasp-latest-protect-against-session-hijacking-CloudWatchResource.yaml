  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It does not directly handle session management or authentication
    mechanisms. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-protect-against-session-hijacking'
    security check, which focuses on protecting against session hijacking attacks
    in web applications.
