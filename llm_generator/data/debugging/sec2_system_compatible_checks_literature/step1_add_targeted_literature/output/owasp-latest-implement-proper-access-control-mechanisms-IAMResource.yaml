    description: If issues are found with IAM policies or user access controls, they
      need to be reviewed and updated to align with the principle of least privilege
      and industry best practices for access control.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial review and configuration, with ongoing maintenance
    instructions:
    - Review all IAM policies and ensure they follow the principle of least privilege,
      granting only the necessary permissions for specific resources and actions.
    - Review all IAM users and their assigned policies, and remove any excessive or
      unnecessary permissions.
    - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users with access to sensitive
      resources or privileged operations.
    - Regularly review and rotate IAM access keys, and remove inactive or unused keys.
    - Implement centralized access control management and auditing processes to maintain
      visibility and control over IAM configurations.

  literature: The AWS IAM resource is a critical component for implementing proper
    access control mechanisms in the AWS cloud environment. IAM allows you to create
    users, groups, and roles, and assign them specific permissions through IAM policies.
    These policies define what actions are allowed or denied for which AWS resources.
    By carefully crafting IAM policies and assigning them to the appropriate users,
    groups, or roles, you can enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure
    that only authorized entities can access and perform operations on sensitive resources.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM policies and user access controls are not properly configured, allowing
      unauthorized access or excessive permissions.
    partial: Some IAM policies and user access controls are properly configured, but
      others need attention to fully enforce least privilege and prevent unauthorized
      access.
    success: IAM policies and user access controls are properly configured to enforce
      least privilege and prevent unauthorized access.
  reason: The IAM resource provides the necessary components to implement and manage
    access control mechanisms in AWS. The policies field contains the IAM policies
    that define permissions, and the users field contains information about IAM users
    and their access keys and MFA devices, which are crucial for authentication and
    authorization.
