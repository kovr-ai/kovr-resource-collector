    description: This GitHub resource is not designed to handle authentication or
      brute force attack protection. To implement this security check, you would need
      to configure the appropriate authentication systems and security controls within
      your organization's infrastructure or applications that handle user authentication.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement these measures can vary significantly
      depending on the complexity of your authentication systems and the number of
      applications involved. It may take several hours to several days or weeks for
      a comprehensive implementation.
    instructions:
    - Identify the authentication systems and applications used in your organization
      that require protection against brute force attacks.
    - Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    - Configure IP address blocking or rate limiting for excessive failed login attempts
      from the same IP address.
    - Implement CAPTCHA challenges or other mechanisms to prevent automated brute
      force attacks.
    - Monitor and review authentication logs for suspicious activity or potential
      brute force attack attempts.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The GitHub resource provided does not contain any information related
    to authentication mechanisms, account lockouts, IP address blocking, or CAPTCHA
    challenges. This resource primarily focuses on repository data, collaboration
    details, security advisories, and code scanning alerts. While these aspects are
    important for overall security, they do not directly address protection against
    brute force attacks on authentication systems.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub resource does not have any mechanisms to protect against brute
      force attacks on authentication systems.
    partial: The GitHub resource partially implements protection against brute force
      attacks on authentication systems, but additional measures are required.
    success: The GitHub resource has appropriate measures in place to protect against
      brute force attacks on authentication systems.
  reason: The GitHub resource does not contain any relevant fields or configurations
    for implementing protection against brute force attacks on authentication systems.
    This security check is not applicable to this resource.
