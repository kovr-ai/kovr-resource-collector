    description: To implement brute force attack protection, you would need to configure
      the relevant authentication settings and policies within the Google Cloud Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) service or other applicable services that handle
      user authentication and access control.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Review the Google Cloud IAM documentation for configuring authentication
      policies and brute force protection mechanisms.
    - 2. Identify the appropriate service or resource that handles authentication
      for your application or environment.
    - 3. Configure account lockout policies, IP address blocking, CAPTCHA challenges,
      or other relevant brute force protection mechanisms based on your specific requirements
      and risk profile.
    - 4. Monitor and review authentication logs and security events to detect and
      respond to potential brute force attack attempts.

  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' from Google Cloud Platform does
    not appear to be directly applicable for implementing protection against brute
    force attacks on authentication systems. This resource represents user account
    information and does not contain any fields related to authentication mechanisms,
    lockout policies, or brute force protection configurations.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource does not have any brute force protection mechanisms configured,
      leaving it vulnerable to systematic credential guessing attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The resource has appropriate brute force protection mechanisms configured,
      such as account lockouts, IP address blocking, and CAPTCHA challenges.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any fields or properties related to authentication
    settings, lockout policies, or brute force protection mechanisms. It is primarily
    focused on storing user account details and profile information.
