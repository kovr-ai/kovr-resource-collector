    description: This resource is not applicable for this security check. To implement
      encryption for data at rest, you should review and configure encryption settings
      for your persistent data storage resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon
      EBS volumes, Amazon RDS databases, and Amazon DynamoDB tables.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number of resources
      and the complexity of your environment.
    instructions:
    - Identify the persistent data storage resources in your AWS environment that
      store sensitive data.
    - Review the encryption settings for each resource and ensure that encryption
      is enabled using industry-standard algorithms and key management practices.
    - Configure encryption settings for resources that do not have encryption enabled
      or have weak encryption configurations.
    - Implement centralized key management practices using AWS Key Management Service
      (KMS) or other secure key management solutions.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is a service that records AWS API calls
    and related events for your account. It does not directly implement encryption
    for data at rest. The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-at-rest'
    is focused on ensuring that sensitive data stored in persistent storage (e.g.,
    databases, object storage, file systems) is encrypted at rest using industry-standard
    encryption algorithms and key management practices. While CloudTrail can log events
    related to encryption key management and usage, it does not directly handle the
    encryption of data at rest.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-at-rest'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-at-rest'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-at-rest'
      security check.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is a logging and auditing service that records API
    activity, but it does not directly handle the encryption of data at rest. This
    security check is focused on ensuring that persistent data storage resources (e.g.,
    databases, object storage) have encryption enabled for data at rest.
