  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to security policies
    or their review and update processes. This resource represents various components
    of the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service, such as instances, security groups,
    and networking resources. While these resources may be subject to security policies,
    the EC2Resource itself does not contain information about the policies or their
    management.
