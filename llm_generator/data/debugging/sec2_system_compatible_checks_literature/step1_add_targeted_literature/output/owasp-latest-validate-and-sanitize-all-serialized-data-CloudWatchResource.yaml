    description: This security check is not applicable to the CloudWatch resource
      in AWS.
    estimated_time: N/A

  is_valid: false
  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS does not directly handle serialized data
    or deserialization operations. It is primarily used for monitoring and logging
    purposes, such as creating alarms, dashboards, and log groups. Therefore, this
    resource is not directly applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-serialized-data'
    security check, which focuses on validating and sanitizing serialized data to
    prevent insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource does not handle serialized data or deserialization
      operations, so this check is not applicable.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource does not handle serialized data or deserialization
      operations, so this check is not applicable.
    success: The CloudWatch resource does not handle serialized data or deserialization
      operations, so this check is not applicable.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource does not deal with serialized data or deserialization
    operations, which are the primary focus of this security check. It is a monitoring
    and logging service, and its field paths do not relate to the validation and sanitization
    of serialized data.
