    description: This resource is not relevant for conducting static code analysis
      or using the OWASP static code analysis tool. To implement this security check,
      you should consider using other AWS services or tools specifically designed
      for static code analysis and vulnerability detection.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of your application and the
      chosen static code analysis solution.
    instructions:
    - Explore AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, or AWS Lambda functions for integrating
      static code analysis tools like OWASP ZAP or SonarQube into your CI/CD pipeline.
    - Investigate third-party static code analysis tools or services that can be integrated
      with your AWS environment.
    - Implement processes and procedures to ensure that static code analysis is performed
      regularly during the software development lifecycle.

  literature: The CloudWatchResource in AWS does not directly relate to conducting
    static code analysis or using the OWASP static code analysis tool. CloudWatch
    is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, logs,
    and events from various AWS resources and applications. It does not have capabilities
    for analyzing source code or detecting vulnerabilities within the code.
