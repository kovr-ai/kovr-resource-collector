    description: To address this check, the organization should develop and maintain
      a comprehensive vulnerability management plan that outlines the processes and
      procedures for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities
      in their applications and systems.
    estimated_time: Developing a comprehensive vulnerability management plan can take
      several weeks or months, depending on the size and complexity of the organization.
    instructions:
    - Establish a vulnerability management team or assign responsibilities to existing
      personnel.
    - Define the scope of the vulnerability management program, including the types
      of assets and systems covered.
    - Develop a process for regularly scanning and identifying vulnerabilities, using
      tools and techniques appropriate for the organization's environment.
    - Implement a risk assessment methodology to prioritize and categorize identified
      vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.
    - Define remediation strategies and timelines for addressing vulnerabilities,
      taking into account the risk level and available resources.
    - Establish procedures for testing and verifying the effectiveness of vulnerability
      remediation efforts.
    - Implement a process for documenting and reporting on vulnerability management
      activities, including metrics and key performance indicators.
    - Regularly review and update the vulnerability management plan to ensure it remains
      aligned with the organization's evolving needs and the changing threat landscape.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' check
    is designed to ensure that organizations have a documented plan for addressing
    vulnerabilities in their applications and systems. This check is primarily focused
    on the organizational processes and policies related to vulnerability management,
    rather than specific technical controls or configurations.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have a documented plan for addressing vulnerabilities
      in their applications and systems.
    partial: Not applicable for this check.
    success: The organization has a well-defined and documented plan for addressing
      vulnerabilities discovered in their applications and systems.
  reason: The AWS CloudTrail resource is a service that records AWS API calls and
    related events, and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. While CloudTrail
    can be used to monitor and audit activities related to security and compliance,
    it does not directly address the requirement of having a documented plan for addressing
    vulnerabilities. This check is more applicable to an organization's overall risk
    management and vulnerability management processes, rather than a specific cloud
    resource.
