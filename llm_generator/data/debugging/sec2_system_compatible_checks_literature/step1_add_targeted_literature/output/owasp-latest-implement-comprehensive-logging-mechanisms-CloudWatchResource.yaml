    description: 'If CloudWatch is not properly configured for comprehensive logging
      and monitoring, the following steps can be taken to remediate the issue:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the AWS resources and services that require logging and monitoring.
    - 2. Create CloudWatch Log Groups and configure log forwarding from the identified
      resources to the respective Log Groups.
    - 3. Set appropriate log retention policies for the Log Groups based on your organization's
      requirements.
    - 4. Define critical metrics and thresholds for monitoring and incident detection.
    - 5. Create CloudWatch Alarms for the defined metrics and configure appropriate
      actions (e.g., notifications, automated remediation workflows) to be triggered
      when thresholds are breached.
    - 6. Regularly review and update the logging and monitoring configurations as
      your AWS environment evolves.

  literature: AWS CloudWatch provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
    that can be leveraged to implement comprehensive logging mechanisms as recommended
    by OWASP. CloudWatch allows you to collect and monitor logs from various AWS resources
    and services, including EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and other AWS services.
    You can create log groups and log streams to centralize and organize your logs,
    and then use CloudWatch Logs Insights to search, analyze, and visualize log data.
    Additionally, CloudWatch Alarms can be configured to monitor specific metrics
    and trigger actions, such as sending notifications or executing automated remediation
    workflows, based on predefined thresholds.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not configured to collect and centralize logs from relevant
      AWS resources, and/or CloudWatch Alarms are not set up to monitor critical metrics
      and trigger appropriate actions for incident detection and response.
    partial: CloudWatch is partially configured to collect and centralize logs from
      relevant AWS resources, and/or CloudWatch Alarms are partially set up to monitor
      critical metrics and trigger appropriate actions for incident detection and
      response.
    success: CloudWatch is configured to collect and centralize logs from relevant
      AWS resources, and CloudWatch Alarms are set up to monitor critical metrics
      and trigger appropriate actions for incident detection and response.
  reason: AWS CloudWatch provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
    that can be used to implement the OWASP recommendation for comprehensive logging
    mechanisms. CloudWatch Logs can collect and centralize logs from various AWS resources,
    while CloudWatch Alarms can be configured to monitor specific metrics and trigger
    actions based on predefined thresholds, enabling effective incident detection
    and response.
