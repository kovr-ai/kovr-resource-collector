    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-in-transit'
      security check. To address this check, you need to identify and configure resources
      related to network communication and data transmission, such as load balancers,
      virtual private clouds (VPCs), or other networking components.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement this fix will vary depending on
      the complexity of your cloud environment and the number of resources involved
      in data transmission.
    instructions:
    - Identify the resources responsible for handling network communication and data
      transmission in your cloud environment.
    - Review the configuration of these resources to ensure that appropriate encryption
      mechanisms (e.g., TLS, IPsec) are enabled for all data transmissions.
    - Implement encryption for any unencrypted data transmissions, following best
      practices and industry standards.
    - Regularly review and update encryption configurations to ensure they remain
      secure and compliant with the latest security recommendations.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' appears to be related to user account
    information and does not contain any details about network communication or data
    transmission. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the security check
    'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-in-transit', which focuses on ensuring
    encryption for data in transit over networks.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource does not implement encryption for data in transit, leaving
      sensitive information vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access during
      transmission.
    partial: The resource partially implements encryption for data in transit, but
      some transmissions may still be unencrypted, potentially exposing sensitive
      information.
    success: The resource implements appropriate encryption mechanisms for all data
      transmissions, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information
      during transit.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any information related to network communication,
    data transmission, or encryption mechanisms. It is focused on user account details
    and does not have any relevance to the security check for encrypting data in transit.
