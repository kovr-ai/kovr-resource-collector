    description: 'To implement secure software supply chain practices, organizations
      need to establish comprehensive processes and controls across various stages
      of the software development lifecycle, including but not limited to:'
    estimated_time: Implementing secure software supply chain practices is an ongoing
      effort that requires significant time and resources, depending on the organization's
      size and complexity.
    instructions:
    - Implement secure coding practices and code reviews to ensure code quality and
      security.
    - Establish secure build processes with trusted sources and integrity checks.
    - Implement secure testing environments and vulnerability scanning.
    - Implement secure deployment pipelines with access controls and audit trails.
    - Implement software composition analysis to identify and mitigate third-party
      component vulnerabilities.
    - Implement continuous monitoring and incident response processes for software
      supply chain risks.

  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS provides information about IAM users, policies,
    and access keys, which are essential components for managing access and permissions
    within an AWS account. However, this resource alone does not directly address
    secure software supply chain practices, which involve implementing processes and
    controls throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from coding and
    building to testing, deployment, and maintenance.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM Resource configuration does not address secure software supply
      chain practices.
    partial: The IAM Resource configuration partially addresses secure software supply
      chain practices, but additional measures are required.
    success: The IAM Resource configuration adheres to secure software supply chain
      best practices.
  reason: While the IAM Resource can provide insights into access management and policy
    configurations, it does not cover the broader aspects of secure software supply
    chain practices, such as code integrity, build processes, deployment pipelines,
    and vulnerability management.
