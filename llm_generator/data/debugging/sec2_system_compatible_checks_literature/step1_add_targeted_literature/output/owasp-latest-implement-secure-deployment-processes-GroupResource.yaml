    description: To implement secure deployment processes, the organization should
      establish and follow a comprehensive set of security controls and practices
      throughout the deployment lifecycle.
    estimated_time: Implementing secure deployment processes is an ongoing effort
      that may take several months or longer, depending on the organization's size
      and complexity.
    instructions:
    - Implement a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) process that includes
      code reviews, static and dynamic code analysis, and security testing.
    - Establish a vulnerability management program that includes regular scanning
      and patching of applications and infrastructure components.
    - Implement secure configuration management processes to ensure that systems are
      deployed with secure baseline configurations and that changes are properly reviewed
      and approved.
    - Implement access controls and segregation of duties to ensure that only authorized
      personnel can deploy changes to production environments.
    - Establish monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect and respond to potential
      security incidents during the deployment process.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' check is focused
    on ensuring that an organization has implemented secure processes for deploying
    applications and infrastructure components. This includes practices such as code
    reviews, vulnerability scanning, secure configuration management, and access controls
    throughout the deployment lifecycle. However, the Google GroupResource appears
    to be related to managing Google Groups, which are user collections for collaboration
    and access management purposes. This resource does not seem directly relevant
    to deployment processes for applications or infrastructure.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure processes for deploying applications
      and infrastructure components, leaving systems and data at risk of successful
      cyber attacks.
    partial: Some secure deployment processes have been implemented, but there are
      gaps or inconsistencies that need to be addressed.
    success: The organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
      and infrastructure components, including code reviews, vulnerability scanning,
      secure configuration management, and access controls throughout the deployment
      lifecycle.
  reason: The Google GroupResource is primarily used for managing user groups and
    their membership details, which does not directly relate to secure deployment
    processes for applications and infrastructure components. This resource does not
    contain information or configurations relevant to implementing the security check.
