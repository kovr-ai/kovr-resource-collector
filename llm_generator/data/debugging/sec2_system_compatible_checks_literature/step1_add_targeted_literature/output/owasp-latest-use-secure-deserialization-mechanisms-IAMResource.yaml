    description: This security check is not applicable to the IAMResource. To address
      secure deserialization mechanisms, you would need to analyze the application
      code and configurations.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-deserialization-mechanisms'
    is focused on ensuring that applications use secure deserialization mechanisms
    to prevent code execution and data tampering attacks. However, the provided AWS
    IAMResource does not appear to be directly related to application deserialization
    mechanisms. IAMResource represents Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources,
    such as users, policies, and access keys, which are used for managing access and
    permissions within AWS.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use secure deserialization mechanisms, which
      can lead to code execution and data tampering attacks.
    partial: Some components of the application use secure deserialization mechanisms,
      but others do not.
    success: The application uses secure deserialization mechanisms to prevent code
      execution and data tampering attacks.
  reason: The IAMResource is not directly applicable for implementing this security
    check, as it does not contain information about application deserialization mechanisms
    or related security controls.
