    description: This security check is not applicable to AWS S3 buckets, as they
      are object storage services and do not handle user authentication or password
      recovery mechanisms directly.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-password-recovery-mechanisms'
    is related to implementing secure password recovery mechanisms in web applications
    or services that handle user authentication. This check ensures that the application
    has robust and secure processes for allowing users to reset or recover their passwords,
    such as sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using security
    questions.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure password recovery mechanisms,
      leaving user accounts and sensitive data vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The application implements secure password recovery mechanisms, such
      as sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using security
      questions.
  reason: The provided resource is an AWS S3 bucket, which is an object storage service
    used for storing and retrieving data. S3 buckets do not handle user authentication
    or password recovery mechanisms directly. Therefore, this resource is not applicable
    for implementing the given security check.
