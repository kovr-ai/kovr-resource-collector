    description: To address the security check of protecting against session hijacking
      attacks, additional security controls and configurations are required beyond
      the CloudTrail resource.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial configuration, ongoing maintenance and monitoring
      required
    instructions:
    - Implement secure session management practices, such as using secure session
      tokens, implementing session timeouts, and protecting session tokens from exposure
      or guessing.
    - Configure web applications and services to use secure session management mechanisms,
      such as secure cookies, HTTPS, and session token encryption.
    - Implement additional security controls, such as web application firewalls (WAFs),
      to detect and prevent session hijacking attempts.
    - Regularly review and update session management practices and configurations
      to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and auditing
    AWS API calls and events across multiple services. While CloudTrail can provide
    valuable information for security monitoring and incident response, it does not
    directly address the specific security check of protecting against session hijacking
    attacks. Session hijacking is typically mitigated through secure session management
    practices, such as using secure session tokens, implementing session timeouts,
    and protecting session tokens from exposure or guessing. CloudTrail does not directly
    handle these aspects of session management.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource does not directly address session management
      or protection against session hijacking attacks. Additional security controls
      and configurations are required to mitigate this risk.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource provides some visibility into authentication
      and session-related events, but additional security controls and configurations
      are required to fully protect against session hijacking attacks.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to log relevant events and activities
      related to session management and authentication, providing visibility into
      potential session hijacking attempts.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is primarily focused on logging and auditing AWS
    API calls and events, rather than directly addressing session management and protection
    against session hijacking attacks. While CloudTrail can provide valuable information
    for security monitoring and incident response, it does not directly implement
    the specific security controls required for this check.
