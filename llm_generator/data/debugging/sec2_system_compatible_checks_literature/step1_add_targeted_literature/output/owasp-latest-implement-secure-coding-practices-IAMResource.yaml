    description: To implement secure coding practices, the organization should establish
      and enforce secure coding guidelines, provide training to developers, and integrate
      security testing and code review processes into the software development lifecycle.
    estimated_time: Implementing secure coding practices is an ongoing process that
      requires continuous effort and commitment from the organization.
    instructions:
    - Develop and document secure coding standards and best practices based on industry
      guidelines (e.g., OWASP Secure Coding Practices, CERT Secure Coding Standards).
    - Provide training and awareness programs for developers on secure coding techniques,
      common vulnerabilities, and secure coding practices.
    - Integrate security testing and code review processes into the software development
      lifecycle, including static code analysis, dynamic application security testing,
      and peer code reviews.
    - Implement secure coding practices such as input validation, output encoding,
      secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, secure communication, and
      secure error handling.
    - Regularly update and maintain secure coding guidelines and practices to address
      emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing secure
    coding practices within an organization's software development lifecycle. This
    resource represents Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, users, and
    access keys, which are focused on managing authentication and authorization for
    AWS services and resources. While IAM policies can be used to enforce least privilege
    access and restrict certain actions, they do not cover the broader scope of secure
    coding practices such as input validation, output encoding, secure authentication,
    and other coding techniques.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure coding practices throughout
      its software development lifecycle.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented secure coding practices throughout
      its software development lifecycle.
    success: The organization has implemented secure coding practices throughout its
      software development lifecycle.
  reason: The IAMResource is primarily focused on managing access control and permissions
    within the AWS environment, rather than enforcing secure coding practices during
    the software development process.
