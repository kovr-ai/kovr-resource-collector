    description: While S3 itself does not handle input validation and output encoding,
      it is important to ensure that any applications or services that interact with
      S3 implement these security controls. This includes properly sanitizing and
      validating user input before storing data in S3, and properly encoding any user-supplied
      data before rendering it in the application's output.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the applications and services
      involved.
    instructions:
    - Review the applications and services that interact with the S3 bucket to identify
      potential entry points for user input.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that user input
      is properly validated and sanitized before being processed or stored in S3.
    - Implement output encoding mechanisms to ensure that any user-supplied data is
      properly encoded before being rendered in the application's output.
    - Regularly review and update input validation and output encoding mechanisms
      to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-and-output-encoding'
    focuses on ensuring that user input is properly validated and sanitized before
    being processed by an application, and that any user-supplied data is properly
    encoded before being rendered in the application's output. This is a critical
    security measure to prevent various types of code injection attacks, such as Cross-Site
    Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Command Injection.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The S3 bucket configuration does not directly address input validation
      and output encoding requirements.
    partial: The S3 bucket configuration does not directly address input validation
      and output encoding requirements.
    success: The S3 bucket configuration meets the requirements for input validation
      and output encoding.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service for hosting and serving static
    files and objects. It does not directly handle user input or output rendering,
    which is typically done by applications or services that interact with S3. Therefore,
    this resource is not directly applicable for implementing input validation and
    output encoding controls.
