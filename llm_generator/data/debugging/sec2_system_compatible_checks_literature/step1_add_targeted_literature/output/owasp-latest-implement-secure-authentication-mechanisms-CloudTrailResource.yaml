    description: To implement secure authentication mechanisms as per the OWASP security
      check, you should review and configure the authentication mechanisms within
      the applications, services, or identity providers that handle user authentication
      and authorization.
    estimated_time: The time required for implementing secure authentication mechanisms
      can vary significantly depending on the complexity of your environment and the
      existing authentication mechanisms in place. It may take several hours to several
      weeks or months, depending on the scope and level of effort required.
    instructions:
    - Identify the applications, services, or identity providers that handle user
      authentication in your environment.
    - Review the authentication mechanisms implemented by these components and assess
      their compliance with the OWASP security check.
    - Implement or configure appropriate authentication controls, such as brute-force
      protection, credential stuffing prevention, and secure session management.
    - Regularly review and update the authentication mechanisms to address emerging
      threats and best practices.

  literature: The CloudTrail resource in AWS is primarily used for logging and monitoring
    API activity across AWS services and resources. While it can provide valuable
    audit trails and insights into user actions, it does not directly implement secure
    authentication mechanisms as described in the OWASP security check. Secure authentication
    mechanisms are typically implemented within applications, services, or identity
    providers that handle user authentication and authorization.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource does not implement secure authentication mechanisms
      as described in the OWASP security check.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource does not directly implement secure authentication
      mechanisms, but it can provide valuable audit logs for monitoring and investigating
      potential authentication-related incidents.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to log and monitor API activity,
      providing valuable audit trails for security analysis.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is focused on logging and auditing API activity,
    rather than implementing secure authentication mechanisms. It does not directly
    handle user authentication or implement authentication controls such as brute-force
    protection, credential stuffing prevention, or session management.
