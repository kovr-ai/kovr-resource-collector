    description: Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms for all user-provided
      data fields in the UserResource.
    estimated_time: 2-4 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify all fields that accept user input, including contact_info.emails[].address,
      contact_info.phones[].value, and profile_info.languages[].languageCode.
    - Implement input validation rules to ensure that user input adheres to expected
      formats and constraints.
    - Sanitize user input by removing or encoding any potentially malicious characters
      or code.
    - Update the application code to apply validation and sanitization checks before
      storing or processing user input.
    - Implement regular testing and monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of the
      input validation and sanitization mechanisms.
  is_valid: true
  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud contains various fields related to
    user information, including contact details, profile information, and security
    settings. To implement the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
    security check, it is crucial to validate and sanitize any user-provided data
    before storing or processing it. This includes fields such as contact_info.emails[].address,
    contact_info.phones[].value, and profile_info.languages[].languageCode, where
    users may input custom values.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more user input fields in the UserResource are not being properly
      validated and sanitized, leaving the system vulnerable to injection attacks
      and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    partial: Some user input fields in the UserResource are properly validated and
      sanitized, but others are not, leaving the system partially vulnerable to injection
      attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    success: All user input fields in the UserResource are properly validated and
      sanitized, mitigating the risk of injection attacks and other input-related
      vulnerabilities.
  reason: The UserResource contains fields that accept user input, which must be validated
    and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
