    description: To implement secure session management for web applications, you
      need to review and update the application code and configuration, rather than
      making changes to the IAM Resource.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the application
    instructions:
    - Review the application code and identify areas related to session management.
    - Implement secure session management practices, such as generating unpredictable
      session identifiers, protecting session data from tampering, setting appropriate
      session timeouts, and invalidating sessions after logout or inactivity.
    - Test and validate the implementation to ensure secure session management is
      properly implemented.

  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS is primarily used for managing access and permissions
    for AWS resources and services. It does not directly relate to implementing secure
    session management for web applications. Secure session management is typically
    implemented within the application code and configuration, rather than at the
    infrastructure level.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM Resource is not applicable for implementing secure session management
      for web applications.
    partial: The IAM Resource is not applicable for implementing secure session management
      for web applications.
    success: The IAM Resource is not applicable for implementing secure session management
      for web applications.
  reason: The IAM Resource in AWS is focused on managing access control policies,
    user accounts, and authentication mechanisms within the AWS environment. It does
    not provide functionality for implementing secure session management practices
    specific to web applications, such as generating unpredictable session identifiers,
    protecting session data from tampering, setting appropriate session timeouts,
    and invalidating sessions after logout or inactivity.
