    description: To implement centralized log management in Google Cloud Platform,
      you should consider using dedicated services or tools designed for this purpose,
      such as Cloud Logging, Stackdriver, or third-party log management solutions.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance required
    instructions:
    - Identify the sources of log data (e.g., virtual machines, containers, applications)
      that need to be centralized.
    - Configure log forwarding or agent installation on the identified sources to
      send log data to the centralized log management service.
    - Set up the centralized log management service (e.g., Cloud Logging, Stackdriver)
      to receive, store, and analyze the log data.
    - Configure log retention policies, access controls, and alerting rules based
      on your organization's requirements.
    - Integrate the centralized log management service with other security tools (e.g.,
      SIEM, SOAR) for advanced analysis and incident response.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of users,
    which is primarily used for managing access control and permissions. While groups
    can be useful for organizing users and assigning roles, they do not directly relate
    to centralized log management. Centralized log management involves collecting,
    storing, and analyzing log data from various sources (e.g., servers, applications,
    network devices) in a centralized location for security monitoring, incident response,
    and compliance purposes.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource is not applicable for centralized log management.
    partial: The GroupResource is not applicable for centralized log management.
    success: The GroupResource is configured for centralized log management.
  reason: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform is not directly applicable for
    implementing centralized log management, as it is primarily used for managing
    user groups and access control. Centralized log management requires dedicated
    services or tools specifically designed for collecting, storing, and analyzing
    log data from various sources.
