    description: To implement tokenization techniques, you need to look at other AWS
      services or applications that handle sensitive data storage and transmission.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of your environment and the chosen
      tokenization solution.
    instructions:
    - Identify the services or applications that store or transmit sensitive data
      in your environment.
    - Evaluate the available tokenization options for those services or applications,
      such as AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption and tokenization, or
      third-party tokenization solutions.
    - Implement the appropriate tokenization techniques based on your requirements
      and the service/application capabilities.
    - Monitor and maintain the tokenization implementation to ensure ongoing data
      protection.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, such as creating alarms, dashboards, and log groups. It does not directly
    handle sensitive data or provide tokenization capabilities. Therefore, this resource
    is not applicable for implementing tokenization techniques to protect sensitive
    data at rest and in transit.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch resource does not support tokenization techniques for sensitive
      data protection.
    partial: CloudWatch resource does not support tokenization techniques for sensitive
      data protection.
    success: CloudWatch resource is configured to implement tokenization techniques
      for sensitive data.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is focused on monitoring and logging, and does not
    have functionality related to data tokenization or encryption. Tokenization techniques
    are typically implemented at the application or data storage layer to replace
    sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholders.
