    description: To establish an incident response plan, you need to create separate
      documentation and procedures that outline the steps to be taken in the event
      of a security incident.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the organization and the
      level of detail required.
    instructions:
    - Identify key stakeholders and assign roles and responsibilities for incident
      response.
    - Define the procedures for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.
    - Establish communication channels and escalation protocols.
    - Develop recovery strategies and business continuity plans.
    - Regularly review and update the incident response plan based on lessons learned
      and changes in the organization's environment.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a collection of
    entities, such as users or other groups, that can be managed together. While this
    resource is useful for organizing and managing access control, it does not directly
    relate to establishing incident response plans, which involve creating procedures
    and protocols for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents
    or data breaches.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not have an associated incident response plan.
    partial: Not applicable
    success: The GroupResource has a well-defined incident response plan associated
      with it.
  reason: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform is primarily used for managing
    access control and organizing entities, but it does not provide functionality
    or configurations related to incident response planning. Establishing incident
    response plans typically involves creating separate documentation, procedures,
    and protocols that outline roles, responsibilities, and actions to be taken in
    the event of a security incident.
