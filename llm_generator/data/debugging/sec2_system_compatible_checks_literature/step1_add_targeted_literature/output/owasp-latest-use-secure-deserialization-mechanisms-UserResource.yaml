    description: This security check is not applicable to the UserResource. To address
      this check, you would need to analyze the application code that handles deserialization
      of data.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-deserialization-mechanisms'
    is focused on ensuring that applications use secure deserialization mechanisms
    to prevent code execution and data tampering attacks. However, the provided resource
    'UserResource' appears to be related to user management and does not contain any
    information about deserialization mechanisms or application code.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use secure deserialization mechanisms, leaving
      it vulnerable to code execution and data tampering attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses secure deserialization mechanisms to prevent code
      execution and data tampering attacks.
  reason: The UserResource is a data structure representing user information and does
    not contain any details about application code or deserialization mechanisms.
    Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing this security check.
