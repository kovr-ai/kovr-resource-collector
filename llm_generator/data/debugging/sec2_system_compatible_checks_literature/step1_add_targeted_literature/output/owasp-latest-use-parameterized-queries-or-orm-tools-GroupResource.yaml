  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    is focused on preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries
    or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools when interacting with databases. This
    check is primarily applicable to application code and database interactions, rather
    than a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource like GroupResource.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not interact with databases or handle SQL queries,
      so this check is not applicable.
    partial: This check is not partially applicable to the GroupResource.
    success: The GroupResource is configured to use parameterized queries or ORM tools
      when interacting with databases.
  reason: The GroupResource in GCP is used to manage groups and their membership information.
    It does not directly interact with databases or handle SQL queries. Therefore,
    this resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    security check.
