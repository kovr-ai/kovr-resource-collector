    description: To address issues related to server-side access control implementation,
      a thorough review and testing of the application code is required.
    estimated_time: Depending on the complexity of the application, this process can
      take several days to weeks.
    instructions:
    - Identify and document all server-side resources and data that require access
      control.
    - Review the application code to ensure proper authentication and authorization
      mechanisms are in place for accessing protected resources.
    - Implement centralized access control mechanisms and avoid duplicating access
      control logic throughout the codebase.
    - Conduct thorough testing, including penetration testing, to validate the effectiveness
      of the implemented access controls.
    - Regularly review and update access control mechanisms to address new threats
      and vulnerabilities.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' security
    check is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on
    the server-side of an application. This check helps identify and mitigate risks
    associated with improper access control implementation, such as broken authentication,
    broken access control, and insecure direct object references. However, the provided
    AWS EC2Resource does not contain any information related to application code or
    server-side access control implementation. The EC2Resource represents AWS Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, networking resources, and related metadata, which
    are infrastructure-level resources.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application's server-side access controls are not properly implemented
      or validated, posing potential security risks.
    partial: Some aspects of the application's server-side access controls are properly
      implemented and validated, but other aspects require further attention.
    success: The application's server-side access controls are properly implemented
      and validated.
  reason: The AWS EC2Resource does not contain any information related to application
    code or server-side access control implementation. This resource represents infrastructure-level
    resources, such as EC2 instances, networking components, and related metadata.
    The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' security check
    is focused on validating access controls implemented within the application code
    running on the server-side, which is not covered by the EC2Resource.
