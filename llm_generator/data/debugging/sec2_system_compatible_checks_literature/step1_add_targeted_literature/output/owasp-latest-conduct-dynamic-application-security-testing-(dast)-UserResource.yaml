    description: To implement DAST, you need to identify and analyze the web applications
      deployed in your cloud environment. The UserResource does not provide the necessary
      information or functionality for this purpose.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the number and complexity of web applications.
    instructions:
    - Identify the web applications deployed in your cloud environment.
    - Obtain information about the web application's architecture, endpoints, and
      functionality.
    - Use a DAST tool or service to simulate real-world attacks against the web application
      and analyze its responses.
    - Review the DAST tool's findings and remediate any identified vulnerabilities.

  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly applicable
    for conducting Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). DAST is a technique
    used to identify security vulnerabilities in web applications by simulating real-world
    attacks and analyzing the application's behavior and responses. The UserResource
    represents user information and account details, but it does not contain information
    about web applications or their security posture.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for conducting Dynamic Application Security
      Testing (DAST).
    partial: This resource is not applicable for conducting Dynamic Application Security
      Testing (DAST).
    success: This resource is not applicable for conducting Dynamic Application Security
      Testing (DAST).
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any information related to web applications
    or their security vulnerabilities. DAST is specifically focused on testing the
    security of web applications by simulating attacks and analyzing their responses.
    The UserResource represents user account information and does not provide the
    necessary data or functionality to conduct DAST.
