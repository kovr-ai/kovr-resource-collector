    description: To implement secure coding practices, the organization needs to establish
      and enforce secure coding guidelines, provide training to developers, and implement
      security controls throughout the software development lifecycle.
    estimated_time: Implementing secure coding practices is an ongoing process that
      requires continuous effort and commitment. The initial setup and training may
      take several weeks or months, depending on the size and complexity of the organization.
    instructions:
    - Adopt industry-standard secure coding guidelines, such as the OWASP Secure Coding
      Practices or the CERT Secure Coding Standards.
    - Provide training and resources to developers on secure coding practices, including
      input validation, authentication and authorization, data protection, and secure
      communication.
    - Implement security controls and tools, such as static code analysis, dynamic
      application security testing (DAST), and software composition analysis (SCA),
      to identify and remediate coding vulnerabilities.
    - Establish secure coding review processes and code review practices to ensure
      that secure coding practices are followed consistently.
    - Continuously monitor and update secure coding practices to address emerging
      threats and vulnerabilities.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a collection of
    entities, such as users or service accounts, that can be managed together. While
    this resource is useful for managing access and permissions, it does not directly
    relate to implementing secure coding practices for software development.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure coding practices throughout
      the software development lifecycle, leaving their applications vulnerable to
      common coding vulnerabilities.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented secure coding practices, but
      there are still gaps or areas that need improvement.
    success: The organization has implemented secure coding practices throughout the
      software development lifecycle, following industry-standard guidelines and implementing
      security controls to prevent common coding vulnerabilities.
  reason: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-coding-practices' focuses
    on adopting secure coding practices throughout the software development lifecycle,
    which involves following industry-standard guidelines, using secure coding techniques,
    and implementing security controls to prevent common coding vulnerabilities. The
    GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform is primarily used for managing access and
    permissions, and does not directly address secure coding practices for software
    development.
