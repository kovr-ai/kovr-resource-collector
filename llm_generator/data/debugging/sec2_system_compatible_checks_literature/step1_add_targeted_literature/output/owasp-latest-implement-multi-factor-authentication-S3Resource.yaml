  literature: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service for storing and retrieving
    data. It does not have any direct capabilities for implementing multi-factor authentication
    (MFA) for user accounts. MFA is typically implemented at the Identity and Access
    Management (IAM) level or through other authentication services like Amazon Cognito.
