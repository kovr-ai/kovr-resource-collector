  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly handle user input validation
    and sanitization. This security check is focused on ensuring that all user input
    is properly validated and sanitized before being processed or stored in an application
    or system. The IAMResource manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies,
    users, and access keys, which are not directly related to user input handling.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
      security check.
  reason: The IAMResource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
    security check because it does not handle user input validation and sanitization.
    This check is more relevant for application resources that accept and process
    user input.
