    description: While the AWS CloudTrail resource is not directly applicable for
      implementing the OWASP security hardening guidelines, it can be used in conjunction
      with other AWS services and security measures to enhance the overall security
      posture of web applications and systems hosted on AWS.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of your AWS environment and
      the specific security measures implemented.
    instructions:
    - Review the OWASP security hardening guidelines and identify the relevant areas
      that apply to your web applications and systems hosted on AWS.
    - Implement appropriate security measures and configurations within your AWS environment,
      such as AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF), AWS Shield, and AWS Security Groups,
      to address the identified security requirements.
    - Configure CloudTrail to log and monitor API activity related to the implemented
      security measures, enabling visibility and auditing capabilities.
    - Regularly review and update your security configurations based on the latest
      OWASP guidelines and industry best practices.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide best practices for securing
    web applications and systems, covering areas such as authentication, access control,
    input validation, and secure coding practices. However, the provided AWS CloudTrail
    resource is primarily focused on logging and monitoring AWS API activity, rather
    than directly implementing security hardening measures for web applications or
    systems.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS CloudTrail resource is not configured to implement the OWASP
      security hardening guidelines for web applications and systems.
    partial: The AWS CloudTrail resource is not designed to directly implement the
      OWASP security hardening guidelines for web applications and systems.
    success: The AWS CloudTrail resource is configured to log and monitor AWS API
      activity, which is an important security practice but does not directly implement
      the OWASP security hardening guidelines for web applications and systems.
  reason: The AWS CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and monitoring
    AWS API activity, which is an important security practice but does not directly
    implement the OWASP security hardening guidelines for web applications and systems.
    The OWASP guidelines cover a broader range of security measures, such as secure
    coding practices, input validation, and access control mechanisms, which are not
    directly addressed by the CloudTrail resource.
