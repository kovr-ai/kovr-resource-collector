    description: To implement the 'owasp-latest-conduct-penetration-testing' security
      check, you need to engage with a team of experienced penetration testers or
      utilize specialized penetration testing tools and services provided by your
      cloud provider or third-party vendors.
    estimated_time: The duration of a penetration testing engagement can vary significantly
      depending on the scope and complexity of the cloud environment, but it typically
      takes several weeks to several months.
    instructions:
    - Identify the scope of the penetration testing engagement, including the cloud
      resources, applications, and services to be tested.
    - Engage with a reputable penetration testing team or vendor and provide them
      with the necessary access and documentation.
    - Collaborate with the penetration testing team to define the testing methodology,
      rules of engagement, and reporting requirements.
    - Conduct the penetration testing activities and review the findings and recommendations
      provided by the testing team.
    - Prioritize and remediate any identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses based
      on their severity and potential impact.

  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Penetration testing has identified critical vulnerabilities in the cloud
      environment that need to be addressed immediately.
    partial: Penetration testing has identified some vulnerabilities in the cloud
      environment that should be addressed to improve the overall security posture.
    success: The cloud environment has been successfully tested for vulnerabilities
      through penetration testing, and no critical issues were found.
  reason: The UserResource is a data structure representing user account details and
    does not contain any information or functionality related to conducting penetration
    testing or assessing the security posture of the cloud environment. Penetration
    testing typically involves simulating real-world attack scenarios against the
    cloud infrastructure, applications, and services to identify vulnerabilities and
    weaknesses.
