      user access keys, or MFA device configurations, remediation steps may include:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial review and remediation, ongoing maintenance
      required
    instructions:
    - Review and update IAM policies to follow the principle of least privilege and
      remove any unnecessary or overly permissive permissions.
    - Rotate or disable any inactive or compromised user access keys.
    - Enable MFA for all IAM users with console access or privileged permissions.
    - Implement regular IAM access reviews and clean up any unused or unnecessary
      IAM entities.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement regular security testing
    by analyzing the policies attached to IAM users and roles. By reviewing the policies,
    you can identify any overly permissive or risky permissions that could potentially
    be exploited by attackers. Additionally, you can check for compliance with least
    privilege principles and ensure that users and roles only have the necessary permissions
    required for their job functions.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more IAM policies, user access keys, or MFA device configurations
      pose a security risk and require immediate attention.
    partial: Some IAM policies, user access keys, or MFA device configurations may
      pose a security risk, but further investigation is required.
    success: IAM policies, user access keys, and MFA devices have been reviewed, and
      no security risks or misconfigurations were identified.
  reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM policies, user access keys, and MFA
    device information, which are crucial for assessing the security posture of an
    AWS account and identifying potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
