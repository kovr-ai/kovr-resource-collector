    description: To address this security check, your organization needs to develop
      and document a comprehensive plan for vulnerability management.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Establish a vulnerability management team or assign responsibilities to existing
      security personnel.
    - Define processes for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities
      in applications, systems, and third-party components.
    - Develop a vulnerability disclosure policy and procedures for coordinating with
      external parties.
    - Implement tools and processes for vulnerability scanning, penetration testing,
      and continuous monitoring.
    - Document the vulnerability management plan, including roles, responsibilities,
      and escalation procedures.
    - Regularly review and update the vulnerability management plan to align with
      evolving threats and organizational needs.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' security
    check is designed to ensure that organizations have a documented plan for addressing
    vulnerabilities in their applications and systems. This check is primarily focused
    on the organizational processes and policies related to vulnerability management,
    rather than specific cloud resources.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization does not have a documented plan for addressing vulnerabilities
      in applications and systems. This increases the risk of security incidents and
      data breaches.
    partial: N/A
    success: Your organization has a well-defined and documented plan for addressing
      vulnerabilities in applications and systems.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS is primarily focused on managing Identity and Access
    Management (IAM) resources, such as users, groups, roles, and policies. While
    IAM policies can be used to grant or restrict access to specific AWS services
    and resources, they do not directly address the organizational processes and plans
    for vulnerability management. Therefore, the IAMResource is not directly applicable
    for implementing this security check.
