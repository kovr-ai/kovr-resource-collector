    description: To implement encryption for data at rest in Google Cloud, you need
      to configure encryption settings on the specific storage services or resources
      where data is stored.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number of storage
      resources and the complexity of your environment.
    instructions:
    - Identify all storage resources (e.g., Cloud Storage buckets, Cloud SQL instances,
      BigQuery datasets) that store sensitive data.
    - Enable encryption at rest for each storage resource, either using Google-managed
      encryption keys or customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for more control.
    - Review and follow Google Cloud's documentation and best practices for configuring
      encryption at rest for each storage service.
    - Implement proper key management practices, including key rotation and access
      control policies.
    - Monitor and audit encryption configurations regularly to ensure compliance.

  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to implementing encryption for data at rest. This resource represents user account
    information and metadata, but does not contain any information about storage encryption
    or data at rest encryption configurations.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Data at rest is not encrypted, leaving sensitive information vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    partial: Some data at rest is encrypted, but encryption is not consistently applied
      across all storage resources.
    success: Data at rest is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms
      and key management practices.
  reason: The UserResource is focused on user account details and does not contain
    any fields or properties related to data storage or encryption configurations.
    To implement encryption for data at rest, you would need to configure encryption
    settings on the specific storage services or resources where data is stored, such
    as Cloud Storage buckets, Cloud SQL instances, or BigQuery datasets.
