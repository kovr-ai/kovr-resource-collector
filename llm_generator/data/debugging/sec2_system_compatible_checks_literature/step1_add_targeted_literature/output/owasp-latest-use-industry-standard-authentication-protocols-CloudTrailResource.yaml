    automation_available: false
    description: Since the CloudTrail resource is not applicable for this security
      check, no specific fix is required. However, to ensure that the application
      uses industry-standard authentication protocols, you should review the authentication
      mechanisms used by the application and implement industry-standard protocols
      like OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of the application and the authentication
      mechanisms involved.
    instructions:
    - Identify the authentication mechanisms currently used by the application.
    - Evaluate the security and industry-standard compliance of the existing authentication
      mechanisms.
    - If the existing mechanisms are outdated or non-compliant, plan and implement
      industry-standard authentication protocols like OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML.
    - Test and validate the new authentication mechanisms to ensure proper functionality
      and security.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The CloudTrail resource in AWS is used for logging and monitoring API
    activity across various AWS services. While it is an important security tool,
    it does not directly implement authentication protocols or mechanisms for authenticating
    users and protecting their credentials. The security check 'owasp-latest-use-industry-standard-authentication-protocols'
    is specifically focused on ensuring that the application uses industry-standard
    authentication protocols like OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML to securely authenticate
    users and protect their credentials.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use industry-standard authentication protocols,
      and instead relies on weak or outdated authentication mechanisms, making it
      vulnerable to various attacks like brute-force, credential stuffing, and man-in-the-middle
      attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses industry-standard authentication protocols like
      OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML to securely authenticate users and protect their
      credentials.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is not directly applicable for implementing the
    'owasp-latest-use-industry-standard-authentication-protocols' security check as
    it is a logging and monitoring service, and does not handle user authentication
    or credential management.
