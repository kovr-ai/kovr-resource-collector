    description: If the application is not using industry-standard authentication
      protocols, you should implement one of the recommended protocols like OAuth,
      OpenID Connect, or SAML.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify the authentication mechanisms currently used by your applications and
      services.
    - Evaluate the security and industry-standard compliance of these mechanisms.
    - If they are not compliant, plan and implement the migration to an industry-standard
      authentication protocol like OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML.
    - Update your application code, configurations, and integrations to use the new
      authentication protocol.
    - Test and validate the new authentication implementation thoroughly.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly implement authentication protocols
    or mechanisms. It provides information about IAM users, policies, and access keys,
    which are related to authentication and authorization, but not the specific protocols
    used for authentication. To implement this security check, you would need to analyze
    the authentication mechanisms used by your applications and services, such as
    the use of OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use industry-standard authentication protocols,
      and instead relies on weak or outdated authentication mechanisms, making it
      vulnerable to various attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses industry-standard authentication protocols like
      OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML to securely authenticate users and protect their
      credentials.
  reason: The IAMResource provides information about IAM users, their access keys,
    and policies, which are related to authentication and authorization, but do not
    directly implement authentication protocols. To assess the use of industry-standard
    authentication protocols, you would need to analyze the specific authentication
    mechanisms used by your applications and services.
