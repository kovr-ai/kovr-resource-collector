      or provide relevant configurations, there are no specific fixes to be implemented
      for this security check.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations' security check
    is designed to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and industry
    standards when handling sensitive information. However, the provided GitHub resource
    does not appear to contain any information related to data handling, storage,
    or processing practices. GitHub repositories primarily store source code, documentation,
    and project-related files, but do not inherently handle or process personal data.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub repository does not comply with relevant data protection regulations
      and industry standards for handling sensitive information.
    partial: The GitHub repository partially complies with relevant data protection
      regulations and industry standards for handling sensitive information.
    success: The GitHub repository complies with relevant data protection regulations
      and industry standards for handling sensitive information.
  reason: The GitHub resource does not contain any relevant information or configurations
    related to data protection regulations or the handling of sensitive personal data.
    While GitHub repositories may store code or files that interact with personal
    data, the resource itself does not provide sufficient context or controls to assess
    compliance with data protection regulations.
