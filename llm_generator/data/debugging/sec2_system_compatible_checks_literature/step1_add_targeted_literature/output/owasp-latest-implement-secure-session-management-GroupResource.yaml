    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing secure session management
      practices. To address this security check, you need to review and configure
      the session management settings in your web application or application server.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the session management configuration in your web application or application
      server.
    - Ensure that session identifiers are generated using a secure random number generator
      and are unpredictable.
    - Implement session data protection mechanisms, such as encryption or secure transmission,
      to prevent tampering.
    - Set appropriate session timeouts based on your application's security requirements.
    - Invalidate sessions after logout or after a period of inactivity.
    - Implement additional security measures, such as IP address validation or multi-factor
      authentication, for sensitive sessions.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a collection of
    entities, such as users or service accounts, that can be managed together. It
    does not directly relate to implementing secure session management practices for
    web applications. Secure session management involves protecting user sessions
    from unauthorized access, hijacking, and other attacks by generating unpredictable
    session identifiers, protecting session data from tampering, setting appropriate
    session timeouts, and invalidating sessions after logout or inactivity.

  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not implement secure session management practices.
    partial: The GroupResource partially implements secure session management practices.
    success: The GroupResource implements secure session management practices.
  reason: The GroupResource is used for managing groups of entities in Google Cloud
    Platform, but it does not have any direct functionality related to implementing
    secure session management practices for web applications.
