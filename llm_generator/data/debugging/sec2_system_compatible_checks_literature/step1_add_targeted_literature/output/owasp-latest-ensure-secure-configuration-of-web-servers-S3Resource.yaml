    description: This security check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource. To
      ensure secure web server configurations, you should assess resources specific
      to your web server infrastructure, such as EC2 instances running web server
      software or Elastic Load Balancers.

  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-web-servers'
    is focused on ensuring secure configurations for web servers. However, the AWS
    S3 (Simple Storage Service) resource is an object storage service and does not
    directly relate to web server configurations.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The web server configurations are insecure and do not meet security standards.
    partial: Some web server configurations are secure, but others require attention.
    success: The web server configurations are secure and follow industry best practices.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not contain configurations
    specific to web servers. While S3 can be used to host static websites, it does
    not provide the same level of configuration options as a dedicated web server.
    Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing the given security
    check.
