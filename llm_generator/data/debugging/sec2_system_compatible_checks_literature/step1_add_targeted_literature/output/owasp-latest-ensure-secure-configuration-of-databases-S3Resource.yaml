  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-databases'
    is focused on ensuring secure configuration of databases, including aspects such
    as authentication mechanisms, access controls, encryption settings, auditing,
    and logging. However, the provided AWS S3 resource is an object storage service
    and does not directly relate to database configuration.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to the provided AWS S3 resource.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the provided AWS S3 resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the provided AWS S3 resource.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is an object storage service and does not directly relate
    to database configuration. While S3 buckets can store data, they are not databases
    themselves and do not have the same configuration settings as databases. Therefore,
    this resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-databases'
    security check.
