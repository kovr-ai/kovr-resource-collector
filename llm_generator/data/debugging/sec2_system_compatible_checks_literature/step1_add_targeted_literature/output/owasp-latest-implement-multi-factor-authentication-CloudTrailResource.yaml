    description: To implement MFA for user accounts in AWS, you need to configure
      it through the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
    estimated_time: 15-30 minutes per user
    instructions:
    - 1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
    - 2. Select 'Users' from the left-hand menu and choose the user(s) for which you
      want to enable MFA.
    - 3. Click on the 'Security Credentials' tab and then 'Assign MFA device'.
    - 4. Follow the prompts to set up a virtual or hardware MFA device for the selected
      user(s).
    - 5. After successful setup, the user(s) will be required to provide an MFA code
      in addition to their password when logging in or performing sensitive operations.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. While CloudTrail can provide valuable audit logs, it does
    not directly implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts. MFA
    is a user authentication mechanism that requires two or more factors, such as
    a password and a one-time code from a hardware token or mobile app, to grant access
    to a system or resource.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Multi-factor authentication is not implemented or enforced for user accounts.
    partial: Multi-factor authentication is implemented for some, but not all, user
      accounts.
    success: Multi-factor authentication is implemented and enforced for all user
      accounts.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and auditing purposes,
    and does not directly implement or enforce MFA for user authentication. MFA is
    typically configured at the AWS account level or through other services like AWS
    Identity and Access Management (IAM).
