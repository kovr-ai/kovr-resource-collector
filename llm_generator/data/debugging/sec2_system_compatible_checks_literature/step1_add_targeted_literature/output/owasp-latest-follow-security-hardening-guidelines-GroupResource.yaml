  literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines primarily focus on securing
    web applications and systems, providing best practices for mitigating risks such
    as unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromises. However, the provided
    resource 'GroupResource' from Google Cloud Platform appears to be related to managing
    groups and group memberships, which may not directly align with the scope of the
    OWASP security hardening guidelines.
