  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' check focuses
    on ensuring that an organization has implemented secure processes for deploying
    applications and infrastructure components. This includes practices such as code
    reviews, vulnerability scanning, secure configuration management, and access controls
    throughout the deployment lifecycle. While these processes are crucial for maintaining
    system security, the provided AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not
    directly relate to deployment processes.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes'
      check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes'
      check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes'
      check.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not directly relate to
    implementing secure deployment processes for applications and infrastructure components.
    While S3 can be used as part of a deployment process, it does not inherently implement
    or enforce secure deployment practices. Therefore, this resource is not applicable
    for the given security check.
