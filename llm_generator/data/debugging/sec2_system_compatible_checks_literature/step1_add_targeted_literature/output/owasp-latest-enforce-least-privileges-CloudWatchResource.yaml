  literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' security check is focused
    on ensuring that applications and systems follow the principle of least privilege,
    which restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only those
    permissions that are essential for performing their intended functions. This check
    helps mitigate threats like privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, and
    malicious code execution by ensuring that entities operate with the minimum necessary
    permissions.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges'
      security check.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and observability service that
    collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources and applications.
    It does not directly manage access controls or permissions for users, accounts,
    or processes. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing the
    'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' security check, which is focused on enforcing
    the principle of least privilege for access control.
