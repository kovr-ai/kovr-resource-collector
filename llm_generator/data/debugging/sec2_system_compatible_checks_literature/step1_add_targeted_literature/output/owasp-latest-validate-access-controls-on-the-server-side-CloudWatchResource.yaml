  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. This involves ensuring that only authorized users or entities
    can access and perform specific actions on protected resources or data. The AWS
    CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and observability service that collects and
    tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources and applications.
    While CloudWatch can be used to monitor access patterns and security events, it
    does not directly implement or manage access controls on the server-side of applications.
