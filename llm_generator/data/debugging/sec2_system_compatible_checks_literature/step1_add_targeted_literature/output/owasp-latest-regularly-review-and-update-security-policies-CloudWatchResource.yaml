  literature: The CloudWatchResource in AWS does not directly relate to the review
    and update of security policies within an organization. CloudWatch is a monitoring
    and observability service that collects and analyzes metrics, logs, and events
    from various AWS resources and applications. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor
    security-related events and metrics, it does not provide functionality for managing
    or updating security policies.
