    description: Since the EC2 resource itself does not directly handle network communication
      protocols, the remediation steps would involve configuring the applications
      or services running on the EC2 instances to use secure protocols like HTTPS.
    estimated_time: The estimated time can vary depending on the number of EC2 instances
      and applications involved, as well as the complexity of the configuration. It
      could range from a few hours to several days.
    instructions:
    - Identify the web applications or services running on the EC2 instances that
      handle network traffic.
    - Configure these applications or services to use HTTPS for all network communication.
    - Ensure that the necessary SSL/TLS certificates are obtained and properly configured.
    - Update any client applications or services that communicate with these EC2 instances
      to use HTTPS.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    designed to ensure that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols like HTTPS to protect data in transit. This check is primarily applicable
    to resources that handle web traffic or network communication, such as load balancers,
    API gateways, or web servers.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more EC2 instances are not configured to use secure communication
      protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for web traffic or network communication, exposing data
      in transit to potential interception and tampering.
    partial: Not applicable
    success: The EC2 instances are configured to use secure communication protocols
      (e.g., HTTPS) for all web traffic and network communication.
  reason: The provided resource 'EC2Resource' represents Amazon EC2 instances, which
    are virtual machines used for running applications and workloads. While EC2 instances
    can host web applications or services, they do not directly handle or configure
    the communication protocols used for network traffic. The implementation of secure
    communication protocols like HTTPS is typically handled by the application or
    service running on the EC2 instance, or by other resources like load balancers
    or API gateways that manage the network traffic.
