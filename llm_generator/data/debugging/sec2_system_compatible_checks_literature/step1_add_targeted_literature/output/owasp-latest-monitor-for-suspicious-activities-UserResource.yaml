    description: To implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
      check, you need to identify and utilize resources that provide access to system
      logs, network traffic data, and user activity monitoring capabilities.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify the appropriate Google Cloud Platform resources that provide access
      to system logs, network traffic data, and user activity monitoring capabilities.
    - Configure the necessary permissions and access controls to retrieve and analyze
      the required data sources.
    - Implement a monitoring solution that can ingest and analyze the data sources
      to detect suspicious or anomalous activities.
    - Define rules and alerts to notify the appropriate personnel or trigger automated
      responses when suspicious activities are detected.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to detect and alert on any suspicious or anomalous activities within an organization's
    systems and applications. It continuously monitors user behavior, system logs,
    network traffic, and other relevant data sources to identify potential security
    threats or unauthorized actions. However, the provided UserResource from Google
    Cloud Platform does not contain any information related to monitoring system logs,
    network traffic, or user activities. This resource appears to be focused on storing
    user profile information and account details.
