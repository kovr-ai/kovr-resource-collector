    description: To monitor for suspicious activities, you need to use other AWS services
      or third-party tools that are designed for security monitoring and threat detection.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Consider using AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor API calls made within your
      AWS account.
    - Use AWS GuardDuty to continuously monitor for malicious activity and unauthorized
      behavior.
    - Implement AWS Security Hub to centralize and prioritize security alerts from
      multiple AWS services.
    - Integrate with third-party Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
      tools for advanced monitoring and analysis.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to detect and alert on any suspicious or anomalous activities within an organization's
    systems and applications. It continuously monitors user behavior, system logs,
    network traffic, and other relevant data sources to identify potential security
    threats or unauthorized actions. However, the AWS S3 resource provided does not
    contain any information related to monitoring user activities, system logs, or
    network traffic. S3 is an object storage service and does not have the capability
    to monitor for suspicious activities on its own.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS S3 resource does not have the capability to monitor for suspicious
      activities.
    partial: The AWS S3 resource does not have the capability to monitor for suspicious
      activities.
    success: The AWS S3 resource is configured to monitor for suspicious activities.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource does not contain any information related to monitoring
    user activities, system logs, or network traffic, which is the primary focus of
    the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check. S3 is an object storage
    service and does not have the capability to monitor for suspicious activities
    on its own.
