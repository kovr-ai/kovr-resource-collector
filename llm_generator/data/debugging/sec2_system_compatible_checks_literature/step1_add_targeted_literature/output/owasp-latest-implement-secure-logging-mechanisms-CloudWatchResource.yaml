    description: To fully implement secure logging mechanisms using CloudWatch, ensure
      that log data is collected, encrypted, retained for an appropriate duration,
      and monitored for security-related events.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Create CloudWatch Log Groups to collect log data from relevant AWS services
      and applications.
    - 2. Configure log data encryption using AWS KMS keys to ensure confidentiality.
    - 3. Set log retention policies to maintain an audit trail for a specified duration
      based on organizational requirements.
    - 4. Create CloudWatch Metric Filters to analyze log data for security-related
      patterns or conditions.
    - 5. Configure CloudWatch Alarms to trigger actions (e.g., notifications, automated
      responses) based on Metric Filter conditions.
    - 6. Review and update CloudWatch configurations regularly to align with evolving
      security requirements.

  literature: AWS CloudWatch provides logging and monitoring capabilities that can
    be leveraged to implement secure logging mechanisms. CloudWatch Log Groups can
    be used to collect and store log data from various AWS services and applications.
    Log data can be encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys to ensure
    confidentiality. CloudWatch also supports log retention policies to maintain an
    audit trail for a specified duration. Additionally, CloudWatch Metric Filters
    can be used to analyze log data and trigger alarms or actions based on specific
    patterns or conditions, enabling proactive monitoring and incident response.

  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not configured to securely collect, store, and analyze
      log data, failing to implement secure logging mechanisms.
    partial: CloudWatch is partially configured to implement secure logging mechanisms,
      but some aspects need improvement.
    success: CloudWatch is configured to securely collect, store, and analyze log
      data, enabling secure logging mechanisms.
  reason: AWS CloudWatch provides logging and monitoring capabilities that can be
    used to implement secure logging mechanisms. CloudWatch Log Groups can store log
    data, which can be encrypted and retained for a specified duration. CloudWatch
    Metric Filters and Alarms can be used to analyze log data and trigger actions
    based on specific conditions, enabling proactive monitoring and incident response.
