  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-serialized-data'
    focuses on ensuring that all serialized data is properly validated and sanitized
    before being processed or deserialized. This is to mitigate the risk of attacks
    that exploit insecure deserialization vulnerabilities, which can lead to code
    injection, data tampering, or unauthorized access. However, the provided GithubResource
    does not appear to contain any serialized data or deserialization functionality.
    The resource fields primarily contain metadata, statistics, and information about
    the GitHub repository, its collaborators, actions, and security features.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource handles serialized data or deserialization processes, but
      does not properly validate and sanitize the data, which can lead to security
      vulnerabilities.
    partial: The resource partially validates and sanitizes serialized data, but there
      are still some areas that need improvement.
    success: The resource does not handle serialized data or deserialization processes,
      so this check is not applicable.
  reason: The GithubResource does not seem to handle any serialized data or deserialization
    processes. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-serialized-data'
    security check.
