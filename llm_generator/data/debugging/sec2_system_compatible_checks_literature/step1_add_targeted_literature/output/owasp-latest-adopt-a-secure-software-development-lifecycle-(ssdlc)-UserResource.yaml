    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-adopt-a-secure-software-development-lifecycle-(ssdlc)'
      security check. To address this check, the organization should review its software
      development practices and processes to ensure they align with industry best
      practices for secure software development lifecycles.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the organization's size and complexity of software
      development processes.
    instructions:
    - Identify the relevant team or department responsible for software development
      processes within the organization.
    - Review the organization's current software development practices and processes.
    - Assess the gaps between the current practices and industry-recommended secure
      software development lifecycle (SSDLC) practices.
    - Develop and implement a plan to adopt and follow a secure SSDLC that incorporates
      security considerations throughout the entire software development process.
    - Provide training and resources to development teams to ensure consistent adoption
      and adherence to the secure SSDLC practices.

  literature: The Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of practices
    and guidelines for building secure software from the ground up. It covers various
    phases of the software development process, including requirements gathering,
    design, implementation, testing, and deployment. This security check aims to validate
    whether an organization has adopted and follows an SSDLC to proactively address
    security risks and vulnerabilities throughout the software development lifecycle.
    However, the provided resource 'UserResource' appears to be related to user management
    and does not contain information about the organization's software development
    practices or processes.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not adopted or does not follow a secure software
      development lifecycle (SSDLC) that incorporates security considerations throughout
      the entire software development process.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The organization has adopted and follows a secure software development
      lifecycle (SSDLC) that incorporates security considerations throughout the entire
      software development process.
  reason: The 'UserResource' is focused on managing user information and does not
    contain any relevant data or metadata related to the organization's software development
    lifecycle practices. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-adopt-a-secure-software-development-lifecycle-(ssdlc)'
    security check.
