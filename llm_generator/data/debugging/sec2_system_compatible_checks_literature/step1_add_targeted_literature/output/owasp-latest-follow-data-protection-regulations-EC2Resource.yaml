    description: To address data protection compliance, you need to assess resources
      directly involved in data storage, processing, and transfer, such as S3 buckets,
      RDS databases, and data pipelines.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of your data infrastructure
    instructions:
    - Identify resources handling sensitive data in your AWS environment.
    - Review the configurations and access controls for those resources against relevant
      data protection regulations.
    - Implement necessary controls and safeguards, such as encryption, access restrictions,
      and data retention policies.
    - Regularly monitor and audit data handling practices for ongoing compliance.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations' security check
    is designed to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and standards
    when handling sensitive information. However, the provided AWS EC2Resource does
    not directly relate to data handling or storage. EC2 instances are virtual machines
    used for computing purposes, and the resource fields primarily describe instance
    configurations, networking, and resource limits.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource configurations do not comply with data protection regulations
      for sensitive data handling.
    partial: Some aspects of the EC2 resource configurations comply with data protection
      regulations, but other areas need improvement.
    success: The EC2 resource configurations comply with data protection regulations
      for sensitive data handling.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any information related to data storage,
    processing, or transfer, which are the primary concerns of data protection regulations
    like GDPR and CCPA. This resource is focused on virtual machine provisioning and
    management, rather than data handling practices.
