    description: Since the GroupResource is not a web application or API resource,
      there are no specific fixes related to input validation and output encoding
      for this resource.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to input validation and output encoding for web applications or APIs. This resource
    represents a Google Groups entity, which is used for managing email groups and
    group memberships. It does not contain any information or configurations related
    to handling user input or encoding output data.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not have any configurations related to input validation
      or output encoding, leaving it potentially vulnerable to code injection attacks.
    partial: The GroupResource partially implements input validation and output encoding
      controls, but additional measures may be needed to fully mitigate the risk of
      code injection attacks.
    success: The GroupResource is configured to properly validate user input and encode
      output data, mitigating the risk of code injection attacks.
  reason: The GroupResource is not a web application or API resource, and therefore
    does not have any direct relevance to implementing input validation and output
    encoding controls for preventing code injection attacks.
