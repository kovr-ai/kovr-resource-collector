  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'
    aims to ensure that applications and systems do not expose unnecessary features,
    components, or functionality that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
    However, the provided GithubResource does not seem to have direct control over
    the features or components of the GitHub application itself. This resource appears
    to be focused on retrieving and analyzing data related to a specific GitHub repository,
    such as its branches, collaborators, security alerts, and other metadata.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub repository exposes unnecessary features or components that
      should be removed or disabled to reduce the attack surface.
    partial: N/A
    success: The GitHub repository does not expose any unnecessary features or components
      that could increase the attack surface.
  reason: The GithubResource does not provide direct mechanisms to remove or disable
    unnecessary features or components within the GitHub application. It is primarily
    a data retrieval and analysis resource for a specific repository, rather than
    a resource for configuring or managing the GitHub application itself.
