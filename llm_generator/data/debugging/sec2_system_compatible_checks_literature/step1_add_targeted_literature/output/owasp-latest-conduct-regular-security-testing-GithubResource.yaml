    description: To fully implement this security check, the organization should establish
      a comprehensive security testing program that includes regular penetration testing,
      vulnerability assessments, and code reviews.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the size and complexity of the organization
    instructions:
    - Develop a security testing plan that outlines the scope, frequency, and methodologies
      for conducting security testing activities.
    - Engage qualified security professionals or third-party vendors to perform penetration
      testing and vulnerability assessments on a regular basis.
    - Implement a process for conducting regular code reviews to identify and remediate
      security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    - Document and track the findings and remediation efforts from security testing
      activities.
    - Continuously monitor and update the security testing program to align with evolving
      threats and best practices.

  literature: The provided resource is a GitHub repository, which contains information
    about the repository itself, such as its code, branches, collaborators, and security
    settings. While this resource provides some security-related data like code scanning
    alerts, vulnerability alerts, and security advisories, it does not directly indicate
    whether the organization conducts regular security testing activities like penetration
    testing, vulnerability assessments, or code reviews. To fully implement this security
    check, additional information about the organization's security testing practices
    and processes would be required.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not conduct regular security testing activities,
      leaving it vulnerable to cyber threats, data breaches, and compliance violations.
    partial: N/A
    success: The organization conducts regular security testing activities, including
      penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and code reviews, to identify
      and mitigate potential security risks.
  reason: The GitHub repository resource primarily contains information about the
    repository itself, but does not provide direct evidence of whether the organization
    conducts regular security testing activities as required by the security check.
