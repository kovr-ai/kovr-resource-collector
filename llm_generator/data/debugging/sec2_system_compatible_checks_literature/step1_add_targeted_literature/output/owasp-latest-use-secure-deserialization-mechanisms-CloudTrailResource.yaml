    description: This security check is focused on application-level security controls,
      and the CloudTrail resource is not directly applicable. To address this check,
      you would need to review the application code and configurations to ensure that
      secure deserialization mechanisms are implemented correctly.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the size and complexity of the application.
    instructions:
    - Identify all instances where deserialization is used within the application.
    - Implement secure deserialization mechanisms, such as input validation, whitelisting,
      and strict type constraints.
    - Review and update any third-party libraries or components that handle deserialization
      to ensure they are using secure mechanisms.
    - Implement centralized deserialization logic to enforce security controls consistently
      across the application.
    - Test the application thoroughly to ensure that deserialization vulnerabilities
      have been addressed.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. It does not directly relate to secure deserialization mechanisms
    or preventing code execution and data tampering attacks from insecure deserialization.
    This security check is focused on validating that applications use secure deserialization
    mechanisms to prevent remote code execution, injection attacks, and data tampering.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use secure deserialization mechanisms, leaving
      it vulnerable to code execution and data tampering attacks.
    partial: Some components of the application use secure deserialization mechanisms,
      but others do not, leaving parts of the application vulnerable to code execution
      and data tampering attacks.
    success: The application uses secure deserialization mechanisms to prevent code
      execution and data tampering attacks.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is primarily used for auditing and logging purposes,
    and does not directly implement or configure secure deserialization mechanisms
    within applications. This security check is focused on application-level security
    controls, while CloudTrail is an AWS service for monitoring and logging account
    activity.
