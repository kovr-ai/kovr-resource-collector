    description: To implement the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check,
      you need to configure and review the appropriate logging and auditing mechanisms
      within the Google Cloud environment.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Enable and configure Cloud Audit Logs for your Google Cloud project to capture
      administrative activity and data access logs.
    - 2. Review and customize the log sinks and log filters to capture security-relevant
      events based on your organization's requirements.
    - 3. Integrate the audit logs with a centralized logging and monitoring solution,
      such as Cloud Logging or a third-party SIEM, for analysis and incident response.
    - 4. Establish processes and procedures for regularly reviewing and analyzing
      the security-relevant logs to identify potential threats or unauthorized activities.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. However, the provided Google UserResource does not appear
    to be directly related to logging or auditing security events. This resource represents
    user account information and metadata within the Google Workspace environment.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The system is not logging security-relevant events, which could hinder
      incident response and forensic analysis capabilities.
    partial: N/A
    success: The system is properly logging security-relevant events, enabling effective
      incident response and forensic analysis.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any fields or properties related to logging,
    auditing, or capturing security-relevant events. It is primarily focused on storing
    user account details, contact information, and organizational data. Therefore,
    this resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events'
    security check.
