    description: Review and update S3 bucket configurations to align with the latest
      security best practices and organizational policies.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the number of S3 buckets and
      the extent of configuration updates required.
    instructions:
    - Identify S3 buckets with outdated or insecure configurations based on the security
      check findings.
    - Update encryption settings to use the latest encryption algorithms and key management
      practices.
    - Ensure public access blocks are enabled and configured correctly to prevent
      unauthorized access.
    - Enable versioning for S3 buckets to maintain a history of object changes and
      facilitate recovery from accidental deletions or modifications.
    - Review and update any other relevant S3 bucket configurations, such as access
      control lists (ACLs), bucket policies, and lifecycle rules.

  literature: The AWS S3 resource is applicable for implementing the OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'.
    S3 bucket configurations, such as encryption settings, public access controls,
    and versioning status, should be regularly reviewed and updated to maintain a
    secure posture. Outdated or misconfigured S3 buckets can lead to data breaches,
    unauthorized access, or non-compliance with security standards.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more S3 bucket configurations are outdated or insecure.
    partial: Some S3 bucket configurations are up-to-date and secure, but others require
      review and updates.
    success: All S3 bucket configurations are up-to-date and secure.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource provides configurations that should be regularly reviewed
    and updated to maintain a secure posture, aligning with the OWASP check's objective.
