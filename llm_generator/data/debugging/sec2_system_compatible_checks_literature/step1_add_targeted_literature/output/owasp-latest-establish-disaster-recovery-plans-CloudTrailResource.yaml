    description: To establish comprehensive disaster recovery plans, the organization
      needs to define strategies, procedures, and resources for restoring critical
      operations, data, and systems in the event of a disaster.
    estimated_time: Establishing comprehensive disaster recovery plans can take several
      weeks or months, depending on the size and complexity of the organization.
    instructions:
    - Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities
      that could lead to disruptive events.
    - Develop a business impact analysis to determine the critical operations, data,
      and systems that need to be prioritized for recovery.
    - Define recovery objectives, such as Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery
      Point Objectives (RPOs), for each critical operation, data, and system.
    - Establish redundant infrastructure, data backups, and failover mechanisms to
      ensure the availability of critical resources during a disaster.
    - Document detailed procedures for executing disaster recovery plans, including
      roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and testing schedules.
    - Regularly test and update the disaster recovery plans to ensure their effectiveness
      and alignment with changing business needs and technological landscapes.

  literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related events
    for your account. While CloudTrail can be used to log and monitor activities related
    to disaster recovery processes, it does not directly establish or manage disaster
    recovery plans. Establishing disaster recovery plans involves defining strategies,
    procedures, and resources for restoring critical operations, data, and systems
    in the event of a disaster. CloudTrail can provide valuable audit trails and insights
    into activities during a disaster recovery scenario, but it does not fulfill the
    primary requirement of this security check, which is to have comprehensive disaster
    recovery plans in place.

  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have adequate disaster recovery plans in place,
      putting it at risk of prolonged system downtime, data loss, financial losses,
      and potential regulatory penalties in the event of a disaster.
    partial: The organization has partially established disaster recovery plans, but
      they may be incomplete or lack critical components necessary for effective disaster
      recovery and business continuity.
    success: The organization has established and maintains comprehensive disaster
      recovery plans to ensure business continuity and minimize the impact of disruptive
      events.
  reason: AWS CloudTrail is a logging and monitoring service that does not directly
    establish or manage disaster recovery plans. While it can provide valuable audit
    trails and insights during a disaster recovery scenario, it does not fulfill the
    primary requirement of this security check, which is to have comprehensive disaster
    recovery plans in place.
