    description: While CloudWatch does not directly implement RBAC, it can be configured
      to monitor and track RBAC-related events and activities in other AWS services
      and resources.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the AWS services and resources where RBAC is implemented and needs
      to be monitored.
    - Configure CloudWatch alarms, log groups, and metrics to capture relevant RBAC-related
      events and activities from those services and resources.
    - Set up CloudWatch dashboards and alerts to visualize and notify on RBAC-related
      events and activities.
    - Integrate CloudWatch with other AWS services like AWS Config, AWS Security Hub,
      and AWS Lambda for automated monitoring and remediation of RBAC-related issues.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is a monitoring and observability service
    that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. While CloudWatch itself does not directly implement Role-Based
    Access Control (RBAC), it can be used in conjunction with other AWS services and
    features to support RBAC implementation and monitoring.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not configured to monitor and track RBAC-related events
      and activities.
    partial: CloudWatch is partially configured to monitor and track RBAC-related
      events and activities, but some improvements are needed.
    success: CloudWatch is configured to monitor and track RBAC-related events and
      activities effectively.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource itself does not directly implement RBAC functionality.
    However, it can be used to monitor and track access control events and activities
    related to RBAC implementation in other AWS services and resources.
