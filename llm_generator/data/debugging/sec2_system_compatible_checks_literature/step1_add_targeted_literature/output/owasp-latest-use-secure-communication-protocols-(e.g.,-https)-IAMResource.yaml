    description: Since the IAM resource is not directly applicable for this security
      check, no specific fix is required. However, it is recommended to review other
      resources that handle web traffic or network communication, such as Elastic
      Load Balancing (ELB), API Gateway, or EC2 instances running web servers, and
      ensure that they are configured to use secure communication protocols like HTTPS.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify resources that handle web traffic or network communication within your
      AWS environment.
    - Review the configuration of these resources to ensure that they are set up to
      use secure communication protocols like HTTPS.
    - If any resources are found to be using insecure protocols, update their configuration
      to enforce the use of HTTPS or other secure protocols.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    designed to ensure that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect data in transit from unauthorized access,
    interception, and tampering. This check is primarily applicable to resources that
    handle web traffic or network communication, such as load balancers, API gateways,
    or web servers.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM resource does not have any direct configuration related to secure
      communication protocols.
    partial: The IAM resource partially enforces secure communication protocols, but
      some web-based services or applications may still use insecure protocols.
    success: The IAM resource is configured to enforce secure communication protocols
      for all web-based services and applications.
  reason: The provided resource 'IAMResource' is an AWS Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) resource, which is used for managing user identities, access policies, and
    permissions within an AWS account. It does not directly handle web traffic or
    network communication protocols. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for
    implementing the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' security check.
