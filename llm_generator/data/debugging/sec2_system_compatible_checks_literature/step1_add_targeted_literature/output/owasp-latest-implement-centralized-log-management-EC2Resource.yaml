    description: To implement centralized log management in AWS, you need to use other
      services like Amazon CloudWatch Logs, AWS CloudTrail, or third-party log management
      solutions.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for basic setup, additional time for advanced configuration
    instructions:
    - 'Step 1: Set up Amazon CloudWatch Logs or a third-party log management solution
      to collect and store logs from various AWS services and resources.'
    - 'Step 2: Configure log sources (e.g., EC2 instances, load balancers, databases)
      to send logs to the centralized log management solution.'
    - 'Step 3: Set up log monitoring, analysis, and alerting rules to detect security
      incidents and anomalies.'
    - 'Step 4: Implement log retention policies and access controls to ensure compliance
      with regulatory requirements.'

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to centralized log management.
    Centralized log management involves collecting, storing, and analyzing log data
    from various sources (e.g., servers, applications, network devices) in a centralized
    location. The EC2Resource provides information about EC2 instances, security groups,
    VPCs, and other related resources, but it does not contain log data or log management
    capabilities.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2Resource does not support centralized log management.
    partial: The EC2Resource partially supports centralized log management, but additional
      configuration is required.
    success: The EC2Resource is configured for centralized log management.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain log data or log management capabilities,
    which are essential for implementing centralized log management.
