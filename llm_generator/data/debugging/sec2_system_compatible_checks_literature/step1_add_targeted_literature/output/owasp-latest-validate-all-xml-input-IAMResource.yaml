    description: No fix is required since this security check is not applicable to
      the AWS IAM Resource.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check is designed
    to validate XML input received by an application to prevent XML-based attacks.
    However, the AWS IAM Resource does not directly handle XML input or process XML
    data. IAM is an identity and access management service that manages user identities,
    access policies, and permissions. Therefore, this security check is not directly
    applicable to the IAM Resource.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to the AWS IAM Resource.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the AWS IAM Resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the AWS IAM Resource.
  reason: The AWS IAM Resource does not handle XML input or process XML data. It is
    an identity and access management service that manages user identities, access
    policies, and permissions. The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security
    check is specifically designed to validate XML input received by an application,
    which is not the primary function of the IAM Resource.
