    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-keep-software-up-to-date-with-security-patches'

    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-keep-software-up-to-date-with-security-patches'
      security check.
  reason: The provided resource 'GithubResource' from the 'github' provider appears
    to be related to GitHub repositories and associated data. GitHub repositories
    themselves do not directly involve running software or operating systems that
    require security patching. While GitHub repositories may contain source code or
    configuration files for software applications, the patching and updating of those
    applications would occur separately from the repository itself. Therefore, this
    resource is not directly applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-keep-software-up-to-date-with-security-patches'
    security check.
