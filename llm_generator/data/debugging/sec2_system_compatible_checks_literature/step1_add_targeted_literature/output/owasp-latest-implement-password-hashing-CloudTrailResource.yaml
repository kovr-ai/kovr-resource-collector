    description: This resource is not relevant for implementing password hashing.
      To address this security check, you need to review the application code or authentication
      service responsible for handling user credentials and password storage.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the application complexity and existing authentication
      implementation.
    instructions:
    - Identify the application component or service responsible for user authentication
      and password management.
    - Review the code or configuration to ensure a secure and up-to-date password
      hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2) is being used.
    - Verify that appropriate cost factors and salting are implemented to increase
      the computational complexity of cracking hashed passwords.
    - Consider using a dedicated authentication service or library that provides secure
      password hashing and management out-of-the-box.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. It does not directly relate to implementing password hashing
    for user authentication. Password hashing is typically implemented within the
    application code or authentication service, rather than at the cloud infrastructure
    level.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing'
      security check.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is focused on auditing and logging AWS API calls
    and events. It does not have any direct functionality or configuration related
    to password hashing algorithms or user authentication mechanisms. Therefore, this
    resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing'
    security check.
