  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not appear to contain any serialized data
    that needs to be validated and sanitized. This resource primarily deals with EC2
    instances, networking components like VPCs and security groups, and related metadata.
    It does not handle serialized objects or data structures that could potentially
    contain malicious code or sensitive information.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource does not handle serialized data, so the check is not applicable.
    partial: This resource does not handle serialized data, so the check is not applicable.
    success: This resource does not handle serialized data, so the check is not applicable.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not involve processing or deserializing serialized
    data, which is the focus of this security check. Therefore, it is not applicable
    for implementing this specific check.
