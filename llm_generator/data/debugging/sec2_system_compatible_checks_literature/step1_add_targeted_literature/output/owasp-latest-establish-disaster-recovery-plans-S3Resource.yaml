    description: Implement disaster recovery measures for S3 buckets, including cross-region
      replication, versioning, encryption, and backup strategies.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance and testing
    instructions:
    - Enable versioning for all S3 buckets to maintain a history of object versions
      and facilitate recovery from accidental deletions or overwrites.
    - Configure cross-region replication for critical S3 buckets to replicate data
      across multiple AWS regions, ensuring data availability in case of a regional
      outage.
    - Implement server-side encryption for S3 buckets using AWS Key Management Service
      (KMS) or AWS-managed keys to protect data at rest.
    - Establish regular backup schedules for S3 buckets, either through AWS Backup
      or third-party backup solutions, to enable point-in-time recovery of data.
    - Test and validate the disaster recovery plans periodically to ensure their effectiveness
      and identify any gaps or issues.

  literature: AWS S3 buckets are a critical resource for storing data, and ensuring
    their resilience and availability is essential for maintaining business continuity
    in the event of a disaster. Establishing disaster recovery plans for S3 buckets
    involves implementing measures such as cross-region replication, versioning, and
    backup strategies to protect data integrity and enable rapid recovery in case
    of data loss or system failures.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: S3 buckets lack proper disaster recovery measures, putting data integrity
      and business continuity at risk in the event of a disaster.
    partial: Some S3 buckets have disaster recovery measures in place, but others
      lack adequate protection, leading to potential data loss and operational disruptions.
    success: S3 buckets have adequate disaster recovery measures in place, including
      cross-region replication, versioning, encryption, and backup strategies.
  reason: AWS S3 buckets are a critical storage resource, and establishing disaster
    recovery plans for these buckets is essential for ensuring data protection, business
    continuity, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
