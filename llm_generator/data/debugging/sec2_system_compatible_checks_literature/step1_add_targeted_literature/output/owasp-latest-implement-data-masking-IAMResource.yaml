    description: To implement data masking or obfuscation in AWS, you should consider
      using other services or tools specifically designed for that purpose, such as
      AWS Data Pipeline, AWS Glue, or third-party data masking solutions.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity and volume of data to be masked.
    instructions:
    - Identify the resources or services that contain sensitive data requiring masking
      or obfuscation.
    - Evaluate and select an appropriate data masking solution, such as AWS Data Pipeline,
      AWS Glue, or a third-party tool.
    - Configure and implement the chosen data masking solution according to your organization's
      requirements and best practices.
    - Regularly review and update the data masking implementation to ensure ongoing
      compliance and security.

  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS does not directly handle data masking or obfuscation
    of sensitive information. IAM is primarily responsible for managing access to
    AWS resources, including authentication and authorization of users, groups, and
    roles. While IAM policies can be used to restrict access to specific resources
    and actions, they do not provide functionality for masking or obfuscating data
    within those resources.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM Resource does not provide functionality for data masking or obfuscation.
      This security check is not applicable to the IAM Resource.
    partial: The IAM Resource does not provide functionality for data masking or obfuscation.
      This security check is not applicable to the IAM Resource.
    success: The IAM Resource is configured to properly mask and obfuscate sensitive
      data.
  reason: The IAM Resource is focused on access management and does not provide capabilities
    for data masking or obfuscation. While IAM policies can control access to resources
    that may contain sensitive data, they do not directly handle the masking or obfuscation
    of that data.
