    description: To implement input validation and output encoding, you need to focus
      on the application code running on the EC2 instances or other services that
      handle user input and generate output.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of the application and the number
      of input/output vectors.
    instructions:
    - Review the application code for proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms.
    - Implement output encoding for all user-supplied data rendered in the application's
      output.
    - Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to provide additional input
      validation and output encoding controls.
    - Regularly update and patch the application and its dependencies to address known
      vulnerabilities related to input validation and output encoding.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2 resource in AWS primarily deals with virtual machine instances,
    networking components like VPCs, subnets, security groups, and related resources.
    It does not directly handle application code or user input/output. Therefore,
    this resource is not directly applicable for implementing input validation and
    output encoding controls.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource does not have mechanisms to validate user input or encode
      output data.
    partial: The EC2 resource does not directly handle input validation or output
      encoding, but related security controls may be in place.
    success: The EC2 resource is configured to properly validate user input and encode
      output data.
  reason: The EC2 resource manages infrastructure components and does not contain
    application logic or user input handling mechanisms. Input validation and output
    encoding are typically implemented within application code or web application
    firewalls.
