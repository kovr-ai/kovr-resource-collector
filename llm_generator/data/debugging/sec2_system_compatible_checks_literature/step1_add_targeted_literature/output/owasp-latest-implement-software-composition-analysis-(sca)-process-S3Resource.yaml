    description: To implement an SCA process, you need to use tools and services specifically
      designed for analyzing application codebases and their dependencies.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Evaluate and select an SCA tool or service that integrates with your development
      workflow and supports the programming languages and frameworks used in your
      applications.
    - Configure the SCA tool to scan your application's codebase, including any third-party
      libraries or open source components.
    - Review the SCA tool's reports to identify any known vulnerabilities, licensing
      issues, or outdated components.
    - Develop a process for addressing identified issues, such as updating vulnerable
      components, obtaining proper licenses, or replacing outdated components.

  literature: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service that provides object storage
    through web services interfaces. While S3 is a critical component of many applications,
    it does not directly relate to implementing a Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
    process. SCA is a process for identifying and analyzing open source and third-party
    components used in an application's codebase, not a cloud storage service.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The S3 resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    partial: The S3 resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    success: The S3 resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not directly support implementing
    an SCA process, which is focused on analyzing the components and dependencies
    of an application's codebase. S3 does not provide functionality for scanning code
    or managing software dependencies.
