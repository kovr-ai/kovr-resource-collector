    description: To address this security check, the organization should establish
      a formal process for regularly reviewing and updating security procedures.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify key stakeholders and subject matter experts responsible for security
      procedures.
    - Define a regular cadence (e.g., quarterly, annually) for reviewing and updating
      security procedures.
    - Develop a methodology for gathering and evaluating information on emerging threats,
      vulnerabilities, and best practices.
    - Implement a change management process for updating security procedures and communicating
      changes to relevant personnel.
    - Ensure that updated security procedures are properly documented, disseminated,
      and enforced across the organization.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-procedures'
    recommends regularly reviewing and updating security procedures to maintain an
    effective and up-to-date security posture. However, the Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP) GroupResource does not appear to be directly related to security procedures
    or their review and update processes. This resource represents a group of entities
    (such as users or service accounts) within GCP, and its fields primarily contain
    information about the group's metadata, membership, and configuration.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have a process in place for regularly reviewing
      and updating security procedures, leaving it vulnerable to emerging threats
      and potential compliance violations.
    partial: The organization has a process for reviewing and updating security procedures,
      but it is not consistently followed or does not cover all relevant areas.
    success: The organization has a well-defined process for regularly reviewing and
      updating security procedures to address evolving threats and best practices.
  reason: The GroupResource in GCP is not directly applicable for implementing the
    security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-procedures'
    as it does not contain information or functionality related to security procedures
    or their review and update processes.
