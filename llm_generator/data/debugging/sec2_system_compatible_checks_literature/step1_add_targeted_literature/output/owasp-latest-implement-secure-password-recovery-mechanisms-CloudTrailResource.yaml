    description: This security check is not applicable to the CloudTrail resource,
      as it is focused on logging and auditing rather than implementing secure password
      recovery mechanisms for user authentication.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. It does not directly implement secure password recovery
    mechanisms for user authentication. While CloudTrail can be used to audit and
    investigate potential security incidents related to authentication, it does not
    provide functionality for implementing password recovery processes.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource does not directly implement secure password recovery
      mechanisms for user authentication. This security check is not applicable to
      CloudTrail.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource does not directly implement secure password recovery
      mechanisms for user authentication. This security check is not applicable to
      CloudTrail.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to log and monitor all relevant
      API activity, including authentication-related events, which can aid in investigating
      potential security incidents related to password recovery mechanisms.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and auditing purposes,
    and does not directly implement secure password recovery mechanisms for user authentication.
    This security check is focused on ensuring that applications have robust and secure
    processes for allowing users to recover their passwords or regain access to their
    accounts, which is not a functionality provided by CloudTrail.
