  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to data masking or sensitive data handling. This resource represents a group of
    users or entities within an organization, and the provided field paths do not
    indicate any fields for storing or processing sensitive data that would require
    masking.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not contain any sensitive data fields that require
      data masking.
    partial: Some fields in the GroupResource are properly masked, but others may
      contain unmasked sensitive data.
    success: The GroupResource is configured to properly mask sensitive data fields.
  reason: The GroupResource is primarily used for managing user groups and memberships
    within an organization. It does not seem to be designed for storing or processing
    sensitive data that would require data masking techniques.
