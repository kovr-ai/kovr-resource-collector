  field_paths: []
  fix_details:
    automation_available: true
    description: To implement this check, you would need access to the application's
      source code or a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that can scan the
      code and identify the versions of APIs and libraries used.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the size and complexity of the application.
    instructions:
    - 1. Obtain the application's source code or use an SCA tool to scan the code.
    - 2. Identify all APIs and libraries used by the application.
    - 3. Check the versions of each API and library against the latest secure versions.
    - 4. Update any outdated or insecure APIs and libraries to the latest secure versions.
    - 5. Implement a process to regularly check for and update APIs and libraries
      as new versions are released.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check validates that applications use
    the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities introduced
    by outdated or insecure code. This check is important to ensure that applications
    are built with secure and up-to-date components, reducing the attack surface and
    minimizing the risk of exploitation.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application uses outdated or insecure versions of APIs or libraries,
      increasing the risk of known vulnerabilities.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses the latest, secure versions of all APIs and libraries.
  reason: The provided resource 'GithubResource' does not contain any information
    related to the APIs or libraries used by the application code. This resource appears
    to be focused on metadata and statistics about a GitHub repository, such as collaborators,
    issues, pull requests, and security advisories. While some security-related information
    is present, there is no direct way to assess the versions of APIs or libraries
    used within the application code itself.
