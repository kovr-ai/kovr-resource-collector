    description: To conduct penetration testing, you would need access to the actual
      systems, applications, and infrastructure associated with the GitHub repository,
      as well as the necessary permissions and tools to perform simulated attacks
      and vulnerability assessments.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the scope and complexity of the target systems
      and applications.
    instructions:
    - Identify the systems, applications, and infrastructure associated with the GitHub
      repository.
    - Obtain the necessary permissions and access to these systems and applications.
    - Acquire or develop the appropriate penetration testing tools and methodologies.
    - Plan and execute penetration testing activities against the identified targets,
      following industry best practices and ethical guidelines.
    - Document and report the findings, including identified vulnerabilities and recommendations
      for remediation.

  literature: The provided resource is a GitHub repository, which contains information
    about the repository itself, its collaborators, branches, actions, security data,
    and more. While this data can provide insights into the repository's security
    posture, it does not directly enable or facilitate conducting penetration testing
    against the repository or its associated systems and applications.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub repository resource does not provide the necessary access
      or capabilities to conduct penetration testing against the associated systems
      and applications.
    partial: The GitHub repository resource provides limited information about the
      repository's security posture, but does not enable conducting active penetration
      testing activities.
    success: The GitHub repository resource enables conducting comprehensive penetration
      testing against the associated systems and applications.
  reason: Penetration testing involves actively simulating cyber attacks against an
    organization's systems and applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
    The GitHub repository resource primarily contains metadata and information about
    the repository itself, but does not provide the necessary access or capabilities
    to perform penetration testing activities.
