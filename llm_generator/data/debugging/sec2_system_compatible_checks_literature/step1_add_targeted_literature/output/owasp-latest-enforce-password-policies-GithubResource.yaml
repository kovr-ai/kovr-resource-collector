    description: This resource is not applicable for enforcing password policies.
      To implement this security check, you should review and configure password policies
      at the appropriate level (e.g., system, application, or organization).
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity and number of systems involved.
    instructions:
    - Identify the systems or applications that require password policy enforcement.
    - Review the existing password policy configurations for those systems or applications.
    - Update the password policies to meet the desired security requirements, such
      as minimum length, complexity rules, expiration periods, and restrictions on
      password reuse.
    - Implement the updated password policies and ensure they are enforced consistently
      across the relevant systems or applications.

  literature: The provided resource is a GitHub repository, which does not directly
    relate to enforcing password policies. Password policies are typically implemented
    and managed at the system or organizational level, rather than within individual
    repositories. While GitHub repositories may contain code or configurations that
    interact with authentication mechanisms, they do not inherently define or enforce
    password policies.

    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies'
      security check.
  reason: The GitHub repository resource does not contain any relevant information
    or configurations related to password policies. Password policies are typically
    defined and enforced at a higher level, such as the system, application, or organizational
    level.
