    description: 'If IAM policy and user access key monitoring is not implemented
      or is incomplete, the following steps should be taken:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing monitoring and analysis
    instructions:
    - Enable AWS CloudTrail for logging IAM events and policy changes.
    - Configure CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to monitor and alert on IAM policy changes
      and user access key activities.
    - Implement automated processes to review and analyze IAM logs regularly for anomalies
      and suspicious activities.
    - Establish incident response procedures to investigate and mitigate detected
      security incidents promptly.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS is a critical component for implementing comprehensive
    monitoring mechanisms as outlined in the OWASP security check. IAM (Identity and
    Access Management) policies and user access keys play a crucial role in controlling
    and auditing access to AWS resources and services. By monitoring IAM policies,
    their changes, and user activities, organizations can detect unauthorized access
    attempts, policy modifications, and potential misuse of privileges. This resource
    provides the necessary information to track and log IAM-related events, enabling
    organizations to identify and respond to security incidents promptly.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM policies and user access keys are not being effectively monitored,
      leaving the organization vulnerable to undetected security incidents and unauthorized
      access attempts.
    partial: Some aspects of IAM policy and user access key monitoring are in place,
      but additional measures are needed to achieve comprehensive monitoring mechanisms.
    success: IAM policies and user access keys are being effectively monitored, enabling
      comprehensive monitoring mechanisms for detecting security incidents and unauthorized
      access attempts.
  reason: The IAMResource provides essential information for monitoring IAM policies,
    their changes, and user access key activities, which are critical components of
    a comprehensive monitoring mechanism for detecting unauthorized access attempts
    and potential security incidents.
