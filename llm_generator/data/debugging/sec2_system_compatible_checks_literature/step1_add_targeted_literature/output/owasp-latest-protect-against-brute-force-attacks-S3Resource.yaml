  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-protect-against-brute-force-attacks'
    is focused on protecting against brute force attacks, which typically involve
    systematically trying different combinations of credentials (e.g., usernames and
    passwords) to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts. However, the AWS
    S3 (Simple Storage Service) resource is an object storage service and does not
    have the concept of user accounts or authentication mechanisms. Therefore, this
    security check is not directly applicable to S3 buckets.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 buckets.
    partial: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 buckets.
    success: This check is not applicable to AWS S3 buckets.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is an object storage service and does not have user
    accounts or authentication mechanisms that could be targeted by brute force attacks.
    This security check is more relevant for resources that handle user authentication,
    such as Identity and Access Management (IAM) services or applications with login
    functionality.
