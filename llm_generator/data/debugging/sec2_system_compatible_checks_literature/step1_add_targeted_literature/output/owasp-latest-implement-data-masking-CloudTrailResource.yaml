    description: To implement data masking or obfuscation, you need to configure it
      at the application or database level, where sensitive data is stored and processed.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the application or database
      environment.
    instructions:
    - Identify the applications or databases that handle sensitive data.
    - Evaluate data masking or obfuscation techniques suitable for your use case (e.g.,
      static data masking, dynamic data masking, format-preserving encryption).
    - Implement the chosen data masking or obfuscation technique within the application
      or database layer.
    - Test and validate the implementation to ensure sensitive data is properly masked
      or obfuscated.
    - Monitor and maintain the data masking or obfuscation implementation regularly.

  literature: The CloudTrail resource in AWS is primarily used for logging and monitoring
    API activity across various AWS services. While it can provide valuable audit
    trails and insights into data access and usage, it does not directly implement
    data masking or obfuscation capabilities. Data masking is typically implemented
    at the application or database level, where sensitive data is stored and processed.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource does not implement data masking or obfuscation
      capabilities. Sensitive data may be exposed in logs or other resources.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource is not directly applicable for implementing data
      masking or obfuscation.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to log and monitor data access
      events, providing an audit trail for data usage.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and auditing purposes,
    and does not directly provide data masking or obfuscation capabilities. While
    it can log data access events, it does not have built-in functionality to mask
    or obfuscate sensitive data.
