    description: This security check is not applicable to the 'GroupResource' in Google
      Cloud. However, if you are using third-party components in your software applications,
      it is recommended to implement a process to regularly update and patch them.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the number of components and complexity of
      the applications.
    instructions:
    - Identify all third-party components used in your applications.
    - Monitor for new versions and security updates for these components.
    - Establish a process to test and deploy updates in a timely manner.
    - Automate the update process where possible to ensure consistency and reduce
      manual effort.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-update-and-patch-third-party-components'
    is focused on ensuring that third-party components, such as libraries, frameworks,
    and modules, used in software applications are regularly updated and patched to
    mitigate security vulnerabilities. However, the provided Google Cloud resource
    'GroupResource' appears to be related to managing Google Groups, which are user
    groups for collaboration and access control purposes. This resource does not seem
    to be directly relevant to managing third-party components used in software applications.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application's third-party components are not regularly updated and
      patched, exposing it to known vulnerabilities.
    partial: Some of the application's third-party components are regularly updated
      and patched, but others are not.
    success: The application's third-party components are regularly updated and patched.
  reason: The 'GroupResource' is not directly related to managing third-party components
    used in software applications. It is a resource for managing user groups in Google
    Cloud, which is not the focus of the provided security check.
