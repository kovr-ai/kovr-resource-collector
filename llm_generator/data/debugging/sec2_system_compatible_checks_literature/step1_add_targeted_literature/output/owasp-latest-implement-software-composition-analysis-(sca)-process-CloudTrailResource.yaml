    description: To implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in AWS, you need
      to use other services or tools specifically designed for this purpose, such
      as AWS CodeArtifact, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, or third-party SCA tools.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Evaluate and select an appropriate SCA tool or service that integrates with
      your software development lifecycle and meets your organization's requirements.
    - Configure the selected SCA tool or service to scan your application code and
      dependencies for known vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and outdated
      or unsupported components.
    - Integrate the SCA tool or service into your software development and deployment
      processes, such as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
      pipelines.
    - Regularly review and address the findings from the SCA tool or service, and
      implement necessary mitigations or updates to address identified vulnerabilities
      or issues.

  literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related events
    for your account. It does not directly implement Software Composition Analysis
    (SCA) for identifying and analyzing open source and third-party components used
    in applications. CloudTrail can be used to monitor and audit API activity related
    to other AWS services that may be involved in the software development lifecycle,
    but it does not perform SCA itself.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to log and audit API activity related to
      software development and deployment processes, hindering effective Software
      Composition Analysis (SCA).
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to log and audit API activity related
      to software development and deployment processes, but additional configuration
      is needed for effective Software Composition Analysis (SCA).
    success: CloudTrail is configured to log and audit API activity related to software
      development and deployment processes, enabling effective Software Composition
      Analysis (SCA).
  reason: AWS CloudTrail is a service for logging and auditing API activity, but it
    does not directly implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for identifying
    and analyzing open source and third-party components used in applications. While
    CloudTrail can be used to monitor and audit API activity related to other AWS
    services that may be involved in the software development lifecycle, it does not
    perform SCA itself.
