    description: Configure IAM password policies, enable MFA for all IAM users, and
      rotate access keys regularly to mitigate the risk of brute force attacks.
    estimated_time: 1 hour
    instructions:
    - Review and update the IAM password policy to enforce strong password requirements
      (e.g., minimum length, complexity, expiration)
    - Enable MFA for all IAM user accounts and enforce its usage
    - Set up a process to regularly rotate IAM user access keys and deactivate inactive
      keys
  is_valid: true
  literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement protection against brute
    force attacks on IAM user accounts. By configuring appropriate password policies,
    multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, and access key rotation policies,
    you can significantly reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks on IAM
    user credentials.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM user accounts are not properly configured to protect against brute
      force attacks. Weak password policies, lack of MFA enforcement, and/or inactive
      access key rotation increase the risk of successful brute force attacks.
    partial: Some IAM user accounts are configured with brute force attack protection
      mechanisms, but others are not. Inconsistent security configurations increase
      the overall risk.
    success: IAM user accounts are properly configured with strong password policies,
      MFA requirements, and access key rotation to protect against brute force attacks.
  reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM user accounts, access keys, and password/MFA
    policies, which are essential for implementing brute force attack protection mechanisms.
