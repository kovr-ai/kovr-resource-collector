  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    designed to ensure that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols like HTTPS to protect data in transit. This check is primarily applicable
    to resources that handle web traffic or network communication, such as load balancers,
    web servers, or API gateways. The provided resource 'UserResource' appears to
    be a user management resource for Google Workspace, which does not directly handle
    web traffic or network communication protocols.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource is not configured to use secure communication protocols
      like HTTPS for web traffic and network communication, exposing data to potential
      interception and tampering.
    partial: Some components of the resource are configured to use secure communication
      protocols like HTTPS, but others are not, leaving parts of the communication
      vulnerable.
    success: The resource is configured to use secure communication protocols like
      HTTPS for all web traffic and network communication.
  reason: The 'UserResource' is a user management resource for Google Workspace and
    does not directly handle web traffic or network communication protocols. Therefore,
    it is not applicable for implementing the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols
    (e.g., HTTPS)' security check.
