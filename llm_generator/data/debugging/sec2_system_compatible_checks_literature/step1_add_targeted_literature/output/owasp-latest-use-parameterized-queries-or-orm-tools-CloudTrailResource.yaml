    description: 'This security check is not applicable to the AWS CloudTrail resource.
      However, if you are concerned about SQL injection vulnerabilities in your application
      code, you should implement the following steps:'
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the size and complexity of the application
      code.
    instructions:
    - Review your application code and identify areas where user input is used in
      SQL queries.
    - Replace any instances of string concatenation or interpolation with parameterized
      queries or ORM tools.
    - Validate and sanitize user input before using it in queries.
    - Follow secure coding practices and regularly test your application for SQL injection
      vulnerabilities.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    is focused on preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries
    or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools in application code. This check is primarily
    applicable to application code and databases, rather than cloud resources like
    AWS CloudTrail.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application code does not use parameterized queries or ORM tools,
      leaving it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application code uses parameterized queries or ORM tools to prevent
      SQL injection attacks.
  reason: AWS CloudTrail is a service that logs AWS account activity and events, but
    it does not directly handle application code or database queries. Therefore, this
    resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    security check.
