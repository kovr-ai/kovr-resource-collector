    description: To address this issue, you need to identify all third-party components
      used in your applications and services, and implement a process to regularly
      update and patch them to the latest secure versions.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number of applications,
      services, and third-party components involved, as well as the complexity of
      the update and patching process. It could range from a few hours for simple
      applications to several weeks or months for large, complex environments.
    instructions:
    - 1. Create an inventory of all third-party components used in your applications
      and services.
    - 2. Establish a process to monitor for new security updates and patches for these
      components.
    - 3. Test and validate the updates and patches in a non-production environment
      before deploying to production.
    - 4. Schedule regular update and patching cycles to ensure timely application
      of security fixes.
    - 5. Implement automated tools or processes to streamline the update and patching
      process where possible.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. While it is an important security tool, it does not directly
    relate to updating and patching third-party components used in applications or
    services running on AWS. The security check is focused on ensuring that any third-party
    libraries, frameworks, or modules used in applications are regularly updated and
    patched to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more third-party components used in applications and services
      are outdated and have known vulnerabilities that have not been patched.
    partial: Some third-party components used in applications and services are updated
      and patched, but others are outdated and have known vulnerabilities.
    success: All third-party components used in applications and services are regularly
      updated and patched to the latest secure versions.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is not applicable for implementing this security
    check because it is a logging and monitoring service, not a mechanism for updating
    or patching third-party components used in applications or services.
