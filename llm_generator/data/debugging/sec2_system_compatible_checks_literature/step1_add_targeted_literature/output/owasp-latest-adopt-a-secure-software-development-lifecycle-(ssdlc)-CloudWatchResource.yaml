    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing the OWASP Secure
      Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) security check. To address this check,
      the organization should review its software development processes and ensure
      that security considerations are incorporated throughout the entire lifecycle,
      from requirements gathering and design to implementation, testing, and deployment.
    estimated_time: Implementing a comprehensive SSDLC process can take several months
      or longer, depending on the organization's size and complexity.
    instructions:
    - Establish a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) process that aligns
      with industry best practices, such as the OWASP SSDLC guidelines.
    - Integrate security requirements and threat modeling into the early stages of
      the software development process.
    - Implement secure coding practices and perform code reviews to identify and mitigate
      security vulnerabilities.
    - Conduct security testing, including static and dynamic analysis, penetration
      testing, and vulnerability scanning.
    - Establish secure deployment and maintenance processes, including secure configuration
      management and patch management.

  literature: The OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of
    best practices and guidelines for building secure software from the ground up.
    It emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations throughout
    the entire software development process, from requirements gathering and design
    to implementation, testing, and deployment. However, the AWS CloudWatch resource
    is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, logs,
    and events from various AWS resources and applications. It does not directly relate
    to the software development lifecycle or secure coding practices.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not adopted or does not follow the OWASP Secure
      Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) best practices throughout the software
      development process.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The organization has adopted and follows the OWASP Secure Software Development
      Lifecycle (SSDLC) best practices throughout the software development process.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and observability service that
    collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources and applications.
    It does not directly relate to the software development lifecycle or secure coding
    practices. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the OWASP Secure Software
    Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) security check.
