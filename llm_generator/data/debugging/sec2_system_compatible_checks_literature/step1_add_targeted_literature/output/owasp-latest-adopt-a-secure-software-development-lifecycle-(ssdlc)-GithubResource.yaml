    description: To address this issue, the organization needs to establish and implement
      a comprehensive SSDLC that covers all stages of the software development process,
      from requirements gathering to deployment.
    estimated_time: Implementing a comprehensive SSDLC is a significant undertaking
      and may take several months or longer, depending on the size and complexity
      of the organization and its software development processes.
    instructions:
    - Conduct a thorough assessment of the current software development practices
      and identify gaps related to security.
    - Develop an SSDLC framework that incorporates security practices such as threat
      modeling, secure coding practices, security testing, and secure deployment procedures.
    - Provide training and awareness programs to ensure that all development teams
      understand and follow the SSDLC practices.
    - Implement tools and processes to automate and enforce SSDLC practices, such
      as static code analysis, dynamic testing, and secure deployment pipelines.
    - Continuously monitor and improve the SSDLC practices based on feedback and lessons
      learned.

  literature: The Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of practices
    and guidelines for incorporating security throughout the software development
    process, from requirements gathering to deployment. It involves activities such
    as threat modeling, secure coding practices, security testing, and secure deployment
    procedures. While the GitHub resource provides information about the repository,
    workflows, collaborators, and security features, it does not directly address
    the adoption and implementation of an SSDLC within an organization.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not adopted or does not follow a Secure Software
      Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) that incorporates security practices throughout
      the software development process.
    partial: The organization has partially adopted a Secure Software Development
      Lifecycle (SSDLC), but there are gaps or inconsistencies in incorporating security
      practices throughout the software development process.
    success: The organization has adopted and follows a comprehensive Secure Software
      Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) that incorporates security practices throughout
      the software development process.
  reason: The GitHub resource primarily contains information about the repository
    itself, such as code, collaborators, and security features. However, it does not
    provide insights into the organization's software development processes, policies,
    and practices related to the adoption of an SSDLC. Implementing an SSDLC involves
    organizational-level processes and procedures that span multiple teams and stages
    of the development lifecycle, which is not directly captured by the GitHub resource.
