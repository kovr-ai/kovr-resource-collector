  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' from Google Cloud Platform does
    not appear to be directly applicable for implementing data masking or obfuscation
    techniques. This resource represents user account information and does not contain
    any sensitive data fields that would require masking or obfuscation. Data masking
    is typically applied to databases, data warehouses, or other storage systems that
    contain sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII),
    financial data, or intellectual property.
