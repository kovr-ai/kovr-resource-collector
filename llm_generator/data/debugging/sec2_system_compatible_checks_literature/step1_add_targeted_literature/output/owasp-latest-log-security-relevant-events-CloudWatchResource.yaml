    description: 'If the CloudWatch resource is not properly configured to log and
      monitor security-relevant events, the following steps can be taken to remediate
      the issue:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the AWS resources and services that generate security-relevant logs
      (e.g., VPC Flow Logs, AWS WAF logs, CloudTrail logs, etc.).
    - 2. Create CloudWatch Log Groups to collect and store the identified log data.
    - 3. Configure Metric Filters within the Log Groups to extract and monitor specific
      security-relevant events or patterns.
    - 4. Set appropriate log retention periods to ensure logs are available for incident
      response and forensic analysis.
    - 5. Configure CloudWatch Alarms to receive notifications or trigger automated
      actions based on specific security-relevant events or patterns detected in the
      logs.

  literature: The CloudWatch service in AWS can be used to implement the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events'
    security check. CloudWatch allows you to collect and monitor logs from various
    AWS resources and services, including security-related events. By configuring
    CloudWatch Log Groups and Metric Filters, you can capture and analyze log data
    to detect and investigate potential security incidents, unauthorized access attempts,
    and other security-relevant events.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource is not configured to log and monitor security-relevant
      events, which may hinder incident response and forensic analysis capabilities.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource is partially configured to log and monitor security-relevant
      events, but additional configuration may be required to ensure comprehensive
      coverage.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to log and monitor security-relevant
      events, enabling effective incident response and forensic analysis.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource in AWS provides logging and monitoring capabilities
    that can be used to capture and analyze security-relevant events, which aligns
    with the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' security check.
