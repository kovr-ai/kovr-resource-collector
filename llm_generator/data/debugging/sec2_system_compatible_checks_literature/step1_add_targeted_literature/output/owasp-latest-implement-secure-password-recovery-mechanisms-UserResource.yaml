    description: 'If the application does not currently have secure password recovery
      mechanisms in place, the following steps should be taken:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Implement a secure password reset process that sends one-time password reset
      links to the user's verified email address or recovery email.
    - Ensure that password reset links are time-limited and can only be used once.
    - Avoid using insecure methods like sending temporary passwords in plain text
      or using easily guessable security questions.
    - Implement multi-factor authentication for added security during the password
      recovery process.
    - Regularly review and update password recovery mechanisms to address new security
      threats and best practices.

  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly applicable
    for implementing secure password recovery mechanisms. This resource represents
    user account information and metadata, but does not contain details about the
    authentication or password recovery processes implemented by the application or
    service.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure password recovery mechanisms,
      leaving user accounts and sensitive data vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application implements secure password recovery mechanisms, such
      as sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using secure
      security questions.
  reason: The UserResource contains some fields related to password changes and recovery
    contact information, but does not provide insight into the actual password recovery
    mechanisms or their security implementation. To properly assess secure password
    recovery, the application or service code responsible for handling password resets
    and recovery flows would need to be analyzed.
