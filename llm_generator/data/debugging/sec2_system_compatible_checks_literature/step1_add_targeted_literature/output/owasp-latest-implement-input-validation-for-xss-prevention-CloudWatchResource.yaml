    description: This security check is not applicable to the CloudWatchResource.
      To implement input validation for XSS prevention, you need to focus on the application
      code or web server configuration.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the application
    instructions:
    - Review your web application code and identify all user input sources (form fields,
      query parameters, headers, etc.)
    - Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that user input
      does not contain malicious scripts or code.
    - Use appropriate encoding and escaping techniques when rendering user input on
      web pages.
    - Configure your web server or application server to enable built-in XSS protection
      mechanisms, if available.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the execution of
      untrusted scripts and resources.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The CloudWatchResource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing
    input validation for XSS prevention. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability
    service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. It does not handle user input or web application security directly.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatchResource is not applicable for implementing input validation
      for XSS prevention.
    partial: The CloudWatchResource is not applicable for implementing input validation
      for XSS prevention.
    success: The CloudWatchResource is not applicable for implementing input validation
      for XSS prevention.
  reason: The CloudWatchResource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, and does not have any direct functionality related to input validation
    or XSS prevention in web applications. This security check is focused on implementing
    proper input sanitization and validation mechanisms within the application code
    or web server configuration to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
