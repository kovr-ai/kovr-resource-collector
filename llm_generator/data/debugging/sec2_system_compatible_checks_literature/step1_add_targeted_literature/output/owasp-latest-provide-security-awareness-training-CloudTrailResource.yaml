    description: To address this OWASP check, the organization should establish a
      comprehensive security awareness training program for all employees.
    estimated_time: 2-3 months
    instructions:
    - Identify the key security topics and risks relevant to the organization's operations
      and industry.
    - Develop training materials, such as presentations, videos, and interactive modules,
      covering these topics.
    - Implement a training schedule and delivery method (e.g., in-person sessions,
      online courses, or a combination).
    - Track employee participation and completion of the training programs.
    - Regularly update and refresh the training content to address emerging threats
      and best practices.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and monitoring
    API activity within an AWS account. While it can provide valuable audit trails
    and insights into user actions, it does not directly address the security awareness
    training aspect of this OWASP check. Security awareness training is focused on
    educating employees about cybersecurity best practices, identifying potential
    threats, and promoting a security-conscious culture within the organization.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization lacks formal security awareness training programs for
      employees, increasing the risk of human error and potential security breaches.
    partial: The organization has some security awareness initiatives in place, but
      they are not comprehensive or consistently delivered to all employees.
    success: The organization has implemented comprehensive security awareness training
      programs for all employees, covering topics such as identifying phishing attempts,
      handling sensitive data, and reporting security incidents.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is not directly applicable for implementing security
    awareness training programs. It serves a different purpose of capturing and logging
    AWS API activity for auditing and compliance purposes.
