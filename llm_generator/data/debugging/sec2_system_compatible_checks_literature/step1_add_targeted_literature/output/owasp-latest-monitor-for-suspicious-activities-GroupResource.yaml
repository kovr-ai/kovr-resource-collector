    description: To implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
      check, you would need to utilize other Google Cloud resources and services specifically
      designed for security monitoring and threat detection.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing monitoring and analysis
    instructions:
    - Explore and implement Google Cloud's security monitoring and threat detection
      services, such as Cloud Security Command Center, Cloud Audit Logs, and Cloud
      Operations Suite.
    - Configure these services to monitor user activities, system logs, network traffic,
      and other relevant data sources for your Google Cloud environment.
    - Set up appropriate alerting and notification mechanisms to be notified of any
      suspicious or anomalous activities detected by these services.
    - Regularly review and analyze the security monitoring data to identify potential
      threats or unauthorized activities.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to monitor user behavior, system logs, network traffic, and other data sources
    for potential security threats or unauthorized activities. However, the Google
    GroupResource appears to be a resource representing a Google Group, which is primarily
    used for managing user access and permissions within an organization's Google
    Workspace environment. This resource does not seem to contain information directly
    related to monitoring suspicious activities or security events.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The Google GroupResource is not applicable for monitoring suspicious
      activities and security events.
    partial: The Google GroupResource does not provide complete functionality for
      monitoring suspicious activities and security events.

      and security events.
  reason: The Google GroupResource does not contain any relevant information or capabilities
    for monitoring suspicious activities or security events. It is primarily used
    for managing user access and permissions within Google Workspace, and does not
    provide functionality for monitoring user behavior, system logs, network traffic,
    or other security-related data sources.
