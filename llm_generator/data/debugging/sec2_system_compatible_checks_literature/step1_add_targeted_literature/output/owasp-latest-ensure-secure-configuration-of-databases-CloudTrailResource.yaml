    description: To ensure secure configuration of databases, you need to review and
      update the database settings related to authentication mechanisms, access controls,
      encryption settings, auditing, and logging.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the database authentication mechanisms and ensure strong password policies,
      multi-factor authentication, and role-based access controls are implemented.
    - Configure database access controls to restrict access to only authorized users
      and applications, following the principle of least privilege.
    - Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit, using industry-standard encryption
      algorithms and key management practices.
    - Enable auditing and logging for database activities, including successful and
      failed authentication attempts, data modifications, and administrative actions.
    - Regularly review and analyze audit logs for potential security incidents or
      unauthorized access attempts.

  literature: The CloudTrailResource in AWS is used to capture and log AWS API activity
    and events across multiple services and regions. While CloudTrail can provide
    valuable audit trails and monitoring capabilities, it does not directly relate
    to the secure configuration of databases. This security check focuses on ensuring
    that databases themselves are configured securely, following best practices for
    authentication, access controls, encryption, auditing, and logging.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The database is not configured securely, and its configuration does not
      adhere to industry best practices and security guidelines for authentication,
      access controls, encryption, auditing, and logging.
    partial: Some aspects of the database configuration follow security best practices,
      but there are areas that need improvement to ensure secure configuration.
    success: The database is configured securely, following industry best practices
      and security guidelines for authentication, access controls, encryption, auditing,
      and logging.
  reason: The CloudTrailResource is primarily used for logging and auditing AWS API
    activity, but it does not directly configure or manage the security settings of
    databases. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing this specific security
    check related to secure database configuration.
