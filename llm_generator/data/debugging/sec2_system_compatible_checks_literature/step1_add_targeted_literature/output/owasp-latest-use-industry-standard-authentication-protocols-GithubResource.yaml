  literature: The OWASP latest use industry standard authentication protocols check
    validates that the application uses industry-standard authentication protocols
    and mechanisms to authenticate users and protect their credentials. This is important
    because using weak or outdated authentication protocols can make the application
    vulnerable to various attacks, such as brute-force attacks, credential stuffing,
    and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use industry-standard authentication protocols
      and mechanisms to authenticate users and protect their credentials.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses industry-standard authentication protocols and mechanisms
      to authenticate users and protect their credentials.
  reason: The provided GithubResource does not contain any information related to
    authentication protocols or mechanisms used by the application. The resource fields
    primarily contain metadata about the GitHub repository, such as branches, collaborators,
    issues, pull requests, and security advisories. There is no information about
    the application's authentication implementation or the protocols used for user
    authentication.
