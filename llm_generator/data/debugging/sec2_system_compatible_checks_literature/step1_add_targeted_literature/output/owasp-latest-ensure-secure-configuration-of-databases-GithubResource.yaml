    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-databases'
      security check. To address this check, you would need to assess and configure
      the databases directly, either through their respective management interfaces
      or by reviewing and updating the database configuration files.
    estimated_time: N/A

  is_valid: false
  literature: The provided resource is a GitHub repository, which does not directly
    relate to the configuration of databases. This security check focuses on ensuring
    secure configuration of databases, including aspects such as authentication mechanisms,
    access controls, encryption settings, auditing, and logging. While GitHub repositories
    can contain code or configuration files related to databases, the resource itself
    does not provide direct access or control over database configurations.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The database configurations are insecure and do not meet security guidelines.
    partial: Some aspects of the database configurations are secure, but others require
      attention.
    success: The database configurations are secure and follow industry best practices.
  reason: The GitHub repository resource does not contain information or controls
    specific to the configuration of databases. It primarily contains data related
    to the repository itself, such as code, branches, collaborators, and security
    alerts, but does not provide direct access or management capabilities for database
    configurations.
