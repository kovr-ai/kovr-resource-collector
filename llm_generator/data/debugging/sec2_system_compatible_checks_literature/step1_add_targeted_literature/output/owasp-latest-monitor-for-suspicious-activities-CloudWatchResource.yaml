    description: To fully implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
      security check using CloudWatch, you need to configure appropriate CloudWatch
      Alarms and Log Groups to monitor relevant metrics, logs, and events from your
      AWS resources and applications.
    estimated_time: 2-4 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the critical metrics, logs, and events that could indicate suspicious
      or anomalous activities within your AWS environment.
    - Create CloudWatch Alarms with appropriate thresholds and alarm actions (e.g.,
      sending notifications, triggering automated responses) for the identified metrics
      and events.
    - Configure CloudWatch Log Groups to collect and store relevant log data from
      your AWS resources and applications.
    - Set up CloudWatch Metric Filters and Alarms to monitor and alert on specific
      log patterns or events that may indicate suspicious activities.
    - Regularly review and update the CloudWatch Alarms and Log Groups to ensure they
      are effectively monitoring for new or evolving security threats.

  literature: The AWS CloudWatch service can be used to implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
    security check. CloudWatch allows you to collect and monitor various logs, metrics,
    and events from your AWS resources and applications. By creating CloudWatch Alarms
    and configuring appropriate alarm actions, you can detect and alert on suspicious
    or anomalous activities within your AWS environment.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch Alarms and Log Groups are not configured to monitor for suspicious
      activities within your AWS environment, leaving your resources vulnerable to
      potential security threats.
    partial: CloudWatch Alarms and Log Groups are partially configured to monitor
      for suspicious activities within your AWS environment, but additional configuration
      is required to ensure comprehensive monitoring and alerting.
    success: CloudWatch Alarms and Log Groups are configured to effectively monitor
      for suspicious activities within your AWS environment.
  reason: CloudWatch Alarms can be configured to monitor various metrics and logs
    from AWS services and applications. By setting appropriate alarm thresholds and
    actions, you can detect and alert on suspicious activities, such as unusual resource
    usage patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or security-related events. Additionally,
    CloudWatch Log Groups can be used to collect and analyze log data from various
    sources, enabling you to identify and investigate potential security incidents.
