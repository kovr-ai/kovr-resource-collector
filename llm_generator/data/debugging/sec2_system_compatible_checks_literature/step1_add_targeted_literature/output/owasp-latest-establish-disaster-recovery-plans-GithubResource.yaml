    description: To address this security check, an organization should establish
      and maintain a comprehensive disaster recovery plan that outlines strategies,
      procedures, and resources for restoring critical operations, data, and systems
      in the event of a disaster.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the organization's size and complexity, but
      typically takes several weeks to months to develop and implement a comprehensive
      disaster recovery plan.
    instructions:
    - Identify critical business processes, data, and systems that need to be recovered
      in the event of a disaster.
    - Develop a detailed plan that outlines the steps and resources required for restoring
      these critical components.
    - Establish backup and data replication strategies to ensure data protection and
      availability.
    - Define roles and responsibilities for disaster recovery team members.
    - Regularly test and update the disaster recovery plan to ensure its effectiveness
      and alignment with changing business needs.
