    description: To implement MFA for user accounts in AWS, you need to configure
      it through the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour (depending on the number of user accounts)
    instructions:
    - 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
    - 2. For each IAM user that requires MFA, navigate to the user's details page
      and enable MFA.
    - 3. Follow the prompts to set up an MFA device (virtual or hardware) for the
      user.
    - 4. After enabling MFA, update any policies or configurations that require MFA
      for specific actions or resources.
    - 5. Consider enabling MFA for the root user account as well.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing multi-factor
    authentication (MFA) for user accounts. MFA is typically configured at the AWS
    account level or through Identity and Access Management (IAM) services. The EC2Resource
    provides information about EC2 instances, networking components, and related resources,
    but does not contain details about user authentication mechanisms.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: Multi-factor authentication is not enabled or enforced for one or more
      user accounts in the AWS account.
    partial: Multi-factor authentication is enabled for some user accounts, but not
      enforced consistently across the AWS account.
    success: Multi-factor authentication is enabled and enforced for all user accounts
      in the AWS account.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any information or configuration settings
    related to user authentication or MFA. This resource is focused on managing EC2
    instances, networking components, and related resources within an AWS account.
