  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of users
    or other entities within an organization. While groups can be used for access
    control and authorization purposes, they do not directly relate to providing security
    awareness training to employees. Security awareness training typically involves
    educational materials, training sessions, and assessments to ensure employees
    understand security best practices and can identify potential threats.
