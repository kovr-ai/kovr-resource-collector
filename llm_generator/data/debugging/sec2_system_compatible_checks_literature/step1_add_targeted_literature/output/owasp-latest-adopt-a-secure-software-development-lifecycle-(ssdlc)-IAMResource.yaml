    description: To implement a secure SSDLC, the organization should establish a
      comprehensive set of processes, practices, and tools that address security throughout
      the entire software development lifecycle.
    estimated_time: The implementation of a secure SSDLC is an ongoing process that
      may take several months or longer, depending on the size and complexity of the
      organization and its software development practices.
    instructions:
    - Conduct a thorough assessment of the current software development practices
      and identify gaps or areas for improvement in terms of security.
    - Develop and implement a secure SSDLC framework that incorporates security best
      practices and guidelines from industry-recognized sources, such as OWASP, NIST,
      and ISO.
    - Provide training and awareness programs for developers, testers, and other stakeholders
      involved in the software development process to ensure a consistent understanding
      and adoption of the secure SSDLC.
    - Establish secure coding practices, security testing procedures, and secure deployment
      processes as part of the SSDLC.
    - Continuously monitor and review the effectiveness of the secure SSDLC implementation,
      and make necessary adjustments or improvements as needed.

  literature: The OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of
    best practices and guidelines for building secure software from the ground up.
    It emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations throughout
    the entire software development process, from requirements gathering and design
    to implementation, testing, and deployment. While the IAM Resource in AWS provides
    a way to manage access to AWS services and resources, it does not directly relate
    to the implementation of an SSDLC for software development.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not adopted or does not follow a secure SSDLC, which
      increases the risk of security vulnerabilities and threats in the software development
      process.
    partial: The organization has partially adopted a secure SSDLC, but there are
      gaps or areas for improvement in the implementation.
    success: The organization has adopted and follows a secure SSDLC, which is crucial
      for developing secure and resilient applications that can withstand various
      cyber threats.
  reason: The IAM Resource in AWS is primarily used for managing access control and
    permissions for AWS services and resources. It does not directly relate to the
    implementation of a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), which is a
    set of best practices and guidelines for building secure software from the ground
    up. The SSDLC encompasses various phases of the software development process,
    such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment,
    and emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations throughout
    these phases. While IAM can be used to control access to development resources
    and environments, it does not directly address the implementation of an SSDLC.
