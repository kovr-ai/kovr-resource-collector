    description: To establish and validate incident response plans, you need to review
      and configure resources specifically designed for incident response management,
      such as AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and AWS Security Hub.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance and testing
    instructions:
    - 1. Enable and configure AWS CloudTrail to capture and log API activity across
      your AWS account.
    - 2. Set up AWS Config to continuously monitor and assess the configuration of
      your AWS resources against best practices and compliance requirements.
    - 3. Use AWS Security Hub to centralize and prioritize security findings from
      various AWS services and third-party tools.
    - 4. Create and document incident response procedures, including roles, responsibilities,
      communication channels, and escalation paths.
    - 5. Regularly test and update your incident response plans to ensure their effectiveness.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate to establishing incident
    response plans. This resource provides information about IAM users, policies,
    and access keys, which are essential for managing access and permissions within
    an AWS account. However, it does not contain details or configurations specific
    to incident response procedures.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource does not contain any information related to incident
      response plans.
    partial: The IAMResource partially contains information related to incident response
      plans.
    success: The IAMResource contains information related to incident response plans.
  reason: The IAMResource does not contain any information or configurations related
    to incident response plans. It focuses on managing IAM entities like users, roles,
    and policies, which are important for access control but not directly relevant
    for incident response procedures.
