    description: Since the GitHub resource does not contain any sensitive data or
      mechanisms for data masking, there is no direct fix required for this security
      check.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-data-masking' focuses on
    implementing data masking techniques to protect sensitive data from unauthorized
    access or misuse. Data masking involves replacing sensitive data with fictitious
    but realistic values, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive
    information during development, testing, or other non-production environments.
    However, the provided GitHub resource does not appear to contain any sensitive
    data or mechanisms for data masking.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub repository does not have any data masking techniques implemented
      to protect sensitive data.
    partial: N/A
    success: The GitHub repository has implemented data masking techniques to protect
      sensitive data.
  reason: The GitHub resource provided contains information about a GitHub repository,
    such as its metadata, collaboration data, security data, and advanced features.
    While it may contain some sensitive information like security advisories or vulnerability
    alerts, there is no indication of data masking techniques being implemented or
    any sensitive data that needs to be masked. Therefore, this resource is not directly
    applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-data-masking' security
    check.
