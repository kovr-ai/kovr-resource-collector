    description: Since the GroupResource is not designed to handle user input, there
      is no direct fix for this security check. However, any applications or services
      that interact with user input and store data in the GroupResource should implement
      proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the application or service.
    instructions:
    - Identify all user input sources in your application or service.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms for each input source,
      such as whitelisting, blacklisting, input filtering, and encoding.
    - Ensure that all user input is validated and sanitized before being processed
      or stored in any data structure, including the GroupResource.
    - Regularly review and update input validation and sanitization mechanisms to
      address new threats and vulnerabilities.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to user input validation and sanitization. This resource represents a group of
    entities, such as users or service accounts, and contains information about the
    group's membership, description, and other metadata. It does not handle or process
    user input directly.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not validate or sanitize user input, leaving it
      vulnerable to injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    partial: The GroupResource partially validates and sanitizes user input, but some
      input fields are still vulnerable to injection attacks.
    success: The GroupResource properly validates and sanitizes all user input before
      processing or storing it.
  reason: The GroupResource is a data structure that stores information about a group,
    but it does not handle user input or perform any input validation or sanitization.
    Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
    security check.
