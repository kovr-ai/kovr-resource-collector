    unique_id: owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-for-xss-prevention
  field_paths: []
  fix_details:
    automation_available: false
    description: Since the GitHub resource does not contain web application code,
      there are no specific fixes that can be provided for this resource. To address
      the XSS prevention security check, you would need to review the actual web application
      code and implement input validation mechanisms.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the size and complexity of the web application.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify all user input sources in the web application (form fields, query
      parameters, headers, etc.)
    - 2. Implement input validation and sanitization for each input source to prevent
      XSS vulnerabilities.
    - 3. Use secure coding practices and libraries/frameworks that provide built-in
      XSS protection.
    - 4. Regularly test and update the input validation mechanisms to address new
      XSS attack vectors.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The GitHub resource provided does not contain any information related
    to web application code or input validation mechanisms. This resource primarily
    contains metadata, statistics, and collaboration data about a GitHub repository,
    but does not provide details about the application code itself or how user input
    is handled. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-for-xss-prevention'
    security check, which focuses on preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
    through proper input validation in web applications.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The web application does not implement input validation, leaving it vulnerable
      to XSS attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The web application implements proper input validation to prevent XSS
      vulnerabilities.
  reason: The GitHub resource does not contain any information about the web application
    code or input validation mechanisms, which are necessary for implementing the
    XSS prevention security check.
