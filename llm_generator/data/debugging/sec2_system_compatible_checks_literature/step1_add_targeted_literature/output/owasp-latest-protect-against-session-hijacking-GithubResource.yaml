    description: To properly assess and remediate any issues related to session hijacking
      protection, you would need to review the application or service code, configuration,
      and deployment details, which are not available in the provided GitHub resource.

  literature: The GitHub resource provided does not contain any information related
    to session management or authentication mechanisms used by the application or
    service hosted on GitHub. The resource fields primarily contain metadata about
    the repository, such as collaborators, branches, workflows, webhooks, and security
    advisories. While some of this information may be tangentially related to authentication
    and access control, there is no direct way to assess session management practices
    or protection against session hijacking attacks based solely on this resource.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application or service hosted on GitHub does not have adequate measures
      in place to protect against session hijacking attacks, leaving it vulnerable
      to unauthorized access and impersonation.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application or service hosted on GitHub implements appropriate measures
      to protect against session hijacking attacks, such as secure session management
      practices, session timeouts, and protection of session tokens.
  reason: The GitHub resource does not contain any relevant information or configurations
    related to session management or protection against session hijacking attacks.
    The resource is focused on providing metadata about the repository itself, rather
    than the application or service hosted on GitHub.
