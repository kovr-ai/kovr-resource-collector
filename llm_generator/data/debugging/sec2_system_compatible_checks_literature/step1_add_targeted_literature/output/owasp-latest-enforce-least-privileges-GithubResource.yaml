    description: Since the GithubResource does not contain information about user
      permissions and access controls, it is not possible to provide remediation steps
      for this specific resource.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check validates that applications
    and systems follow the principle of least privilege, which restricts access rights
    for users, accounts, and processes to only those permissions that are essential
    for performing their intended functions. This helps mitigate threats like privilege
    escalation, unauthorized data access, and malicious code execution.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The repository and organization do not follow the principle of least
      privilege, with excessive permissions granted to users, teams, or processes.
    partial: N/A
    success: The repository and organization follow the principle of least privilege,
      with all users, teams, and processes granted only the minimum necessary permissions.
  reason: The provided GithubResource does not contain any information related to
    user permissions, roles, or access controls within the repository or organization.
    The resource primarily contains metadata about the repository, its branches, workflows,
    collaborators, and security advisories. However, it lacks details on the specific
    permissions granted to different entities (users, teams, etc.) and how the principle
    of least privilege is enforced. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for
    implementing the 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check.
