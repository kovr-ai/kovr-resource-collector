    description: To protect against session fixation attacks, application-level controls
      and secure session management practices must be implemented.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the application and the
      existing security controls.
    instructions:
    - Review the application code and identify areas where session management is handled.
    - Implement secure session management practices, such as generating new session
      IDs after authentication and preventing session fixation attacks.
    - Consider using a secure session management library or framework that provides
      built-in protection against session fixation attacks.
    - Regularly review and update the application's security controls to address emerging
      threats and vulnerabilities.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. While CloudTrail can be used to detect and investigate
    potential security incidents, it does not directly provide protection against
    session fixation attacks. Session fixation is a type of attack that occurs at
    the application level, where an attacker attempts to force a legitimate user to
    use a session ID known to the attacker. To protect against session fixation, application-level
    controls and secure session management practices must be implemented.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS CloudTrail resource is not configured to provide direct protection
      against session fixation attacks. Application-level controls and secure session
      management practices must be implemented to mitigate this risk.
    partial: The AWS CloudTrail resource is not configured to provide direct protection
      against session fixation attacks. Application-level controls and secure session
      management practices must be implemented to mitigate this risk.
    success: The AWS CloudTrail resource is configured to log and monitor API activity,
      which can aid in detecting and investigating potential security incidents, including
      session fixation attacks.
  reason: The AWS CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and monitoring
    API activity within an AWS account. While it can be useful for detecting and investigating
    potential security incidents, it does not directly provide protection against
    session fixation attacks, which occur at the application level and require application-level
    controls and secure session management practices.
