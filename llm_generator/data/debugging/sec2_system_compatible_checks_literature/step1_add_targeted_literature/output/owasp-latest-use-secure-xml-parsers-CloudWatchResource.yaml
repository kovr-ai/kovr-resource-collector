  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' is focused
    on ensuring that secure XML parsers are used when processing XML data to mitigate
    risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML Injection, and Denial of
    Service (DoS) attacks. However, the provided AWS CloudWatch resource does not
    appear to be directly related to XML parsing or handling XML data. CloudWatch
    is a monitoring and observability service that collects and processes metrics,
    logs, and other data from various AWS resources and applications.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers'
      security check.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, and does not directly handle or process XML data. Therefore, it is not
    applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' security
    check, which is focused on ensuring the use of secure XML parsers.
