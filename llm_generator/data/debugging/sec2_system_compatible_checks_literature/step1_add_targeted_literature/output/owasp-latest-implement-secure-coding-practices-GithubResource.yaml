    description: 'To ensure the implementation of secure coding practices, the following
      steps should be taken:'
    estimated_time: Varies based on the size and complexity of the codebase and development
      processes.
    instructions:
    - Establish and document secure coding guidelines and best practices for the organization.
    - Implement secure coding practices throughout the software development lifecycle,
      including code reviews, static code analysis, and security testing.
    - Provide training and awareness programs for developers on secure coding practices
      and common vulnerabilities.
    - Integrate security tools and processes into the development pipeline, such as
      static code analysis, dynamic code analysis, and dependency scanning.
    - Regularly review and update secure coding practices based on industry standards
      and emerging threats.

  literature: The provided resource is a GitHub repository, which contains information
    about the repository itself, its branches, collaborators, actions, security data,
    and more. While this resource provides some insights into the development practices
    and security posture of the repository, it does not directly address the implementation
    of secure coding practices within the codebase or the software development lifecycle
    (SDLC).
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The repository does not implement secure coding practices, and the codebase
      contains potential vulnerabilities or does not follow secure coding guidelines.
    partial: N/A
    success: The repository adheres to secure coding practices, and the codebase follows
      industry-standard guidelines for secure software development.
  reason: The GitHub repository resource provides information about the repository's
    security features, such as code scanning alerts, dependency graph, security advisories,
    and vulnerability alerts. However, it does not provide direct insights into the
    secure coding practices implemented during the development process or the adherence
    to secure coding guidelines within the codebase itself.
