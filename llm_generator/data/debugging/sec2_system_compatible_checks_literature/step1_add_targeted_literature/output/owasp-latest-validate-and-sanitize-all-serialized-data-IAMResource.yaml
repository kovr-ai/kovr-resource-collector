  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly handle serialized data or deserialization
    processes. It represents Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources such as
    users, policies, and access keys. While IAM policies can contain JSON data structures,
    they are not serialized data in the context of this security check. This check
    is more applicable to resources that handle serialized objects or data structures,
    such as web applications, messaging systems, or data storage services.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource does not handle serialized data, so the check is not applicable.
    partial: This resource does not handle serialized data, so the check is not applicable.
    success: This resource does not handle serialized data, so the check is not applicable.
  reason: The IAMResource does not deal with serialized data or deserialization processes
    directly. It manages IAM entities like users, policies, and access keys, which
    do not involve serialization or deserialization in the context of this security
    check.
