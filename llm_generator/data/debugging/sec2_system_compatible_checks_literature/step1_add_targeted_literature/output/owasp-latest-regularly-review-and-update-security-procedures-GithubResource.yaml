    description: To address this issue, the organization should establish a formal
      process for regularly reviewing and updating its security procedures.
    estimated_time: 3-6 months
    instructions:
    - Develop a security governance framework that outlines roles, responsibilities,
      and processes for security risk management.
    - Define a schedule for periodic reviews of security procedures, policies, and
      controls (e.g., annually, bi-annually).
    - Establish a cross-functional team or committee responsible for conducting the
      reviews and proposing updates.
    - Implement a risk assessment methodology to identify and evaluate emerging threats,
      vulnerabilities, and industry best practices.
    - Document and communicate updated security procedures to all relevant stakeholders
      and ensure proper training and implementation.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-procedures'
    recommends regularly reviewing and updating security procedures to maintain an
    effective and up-to-date security posture. This involves assessing and adapting
    security measures to address evolving threats, vulnerabilities, and industry best
    practices. However, the provided GithubResource does not appear to contain information
    directly related to an organization's security procedures or review processes.
    The resource primarily contains data about GitHub repositories, workflows, collaborators,
    and security advisories, but lacks details on the organization's overall security
    governance and risk management practices.
