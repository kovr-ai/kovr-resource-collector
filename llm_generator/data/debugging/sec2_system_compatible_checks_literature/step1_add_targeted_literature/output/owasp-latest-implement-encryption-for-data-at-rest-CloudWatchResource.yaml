    description: To implement encryption for data at rest, you should consider using
      other AWS services specifically designed for data storage and encryption, such
      as Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), Amazon
      Simple Storage Service (S3), or Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the AWS services and resources where sensitive data is stored at rest.
    - Review the encryption options and configurations available for those services.
    - Enable encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or other supported
      encryption mechanisms.
    - Implement appropriate key management practices, including key rotation and access
      controls.
    - Monitor and audit the encryption status and configurations regularly.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It does not directly handle data storage or encryption of data
    at rest. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor and log events related to data
    encryption services like AWS KMS or EBS volume encryption, it does not provide
    the capability to implement encryption for data at rest itself.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not applicable for implementing encryption for data at
      rest.
    partial: CloudWatch is not applicable for implementing encryption for data at
      rest.
    success: CloudWatch is not applicable for implementing encryption for data at
      rest.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is not designed for storing or encrypting data at
    rest. Its primary purpose is to collect and monitor logs, metrics, and alarms.
    While it can integrate with other AWS services that handle data encryption, it
    does not directly implement encryption for data at rest.
