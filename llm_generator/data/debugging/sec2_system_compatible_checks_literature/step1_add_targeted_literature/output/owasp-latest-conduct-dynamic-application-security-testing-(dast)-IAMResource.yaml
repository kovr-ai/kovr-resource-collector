  literature: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a technique used to identify
    security vulnerabilities in web applications by simulating real-world attacks
    and analyzing the application's behavior and responses. It involves interacting
    with the running application from the outside, mimicking the actions of a malicious
    user or attacker. The IAMResource in AWS does not represent a web application
    or service that can be tested using DAST techniques. Instead, it is a resource
    that manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and user access keys.
    Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing the OWASP DAST security
    check.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the OWASP DAST security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the OWASP DAST security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the OWASP DAST security check.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS is not a web application or service that can be tested
    using DAST techniques. It is a resource that manages IAM policies and user access
    keys, which are not directly related to the OWASP DAST security check.
