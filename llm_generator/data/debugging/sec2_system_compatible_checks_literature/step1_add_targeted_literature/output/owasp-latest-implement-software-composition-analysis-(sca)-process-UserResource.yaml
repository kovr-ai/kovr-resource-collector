    description: To implement an SCA process in Google Cloud, you would need to analyze
      the application code and its dependencies, rather than user account information.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the size and complexity
      of the application code and its dependencies.
    instructions:
    - Identify the application code and its dependencies (e.g., open source libraries,
      third-party components) that need to be analyzed.
    - Use a suitable SCA tool or service (e.g., Google Cloud's Container Analysis,
      third-party SCA tools) to scan the application code and its dependencies for
      known vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
    - Review the SCA report and take appropriate actions to address any identified
      vulnerabilities or licensing issues, such as upgrading to a newer version of
      a component or replacing a component with a more secure alternative.

  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly applicable
    for implementing a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) process. SCA is typically
    performed on application code and its dependencies to identify open source and
    third-party components, and analyze them for potential vulnerabilities and licensing
    issues. The UserResource represents user account information in Google Workspace,
    which does not directly relate to the application code or its dependencies.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    partial: The resource partially supports implementing an SCA process, but additional
      resources or configurations are required.
    success: The resource is applicable for implementing an SCA process.
  reason: The UserResource in Google Cloud represents user account information and
    does not contain information about the application code or its dependencies, which
    is necessary for implementing an SCA process.
