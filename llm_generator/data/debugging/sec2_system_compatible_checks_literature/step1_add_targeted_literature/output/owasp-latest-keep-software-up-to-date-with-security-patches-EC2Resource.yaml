  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-keep-software-up-to-date-with-security-patches'
    is focused on ensuring that software and systems are regularly updated with the
    latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities and maintain a strong
    security posture. However, the provided AWS EC2Resource does not contain any information
    related to software patching or update management.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more EC2 instances or components of the AWS infrastructure are
      not up-to-date with the latest security patches, leaving them vulnerable to
      known security vulnerabilities.
    partial: N/A
    success: The EC2 instances and underlying AWS infrastructure are up-to-date with
      the latest security patches.
  reason: The AWS EC2Resource primarily contains information about EC2 instances,
    networking components (VPCs, subnets, security groups, etc.), and other AWS resources
    related to the EC2 service. It does not include any details about the software
    versions, patch levels, or update mechanisms used by the EC2 instances or the
    underlying AWS infrastructure. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for
    implementing the 'owasp-latest-keep-software-up-to-date-with-security-patches'
    security check.
