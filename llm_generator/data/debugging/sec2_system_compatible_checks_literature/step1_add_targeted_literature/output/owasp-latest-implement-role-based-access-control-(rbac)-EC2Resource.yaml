    description: To implement RBAC, you need to define roles, assign permissions to
      those roles, and associate users or entities with the appropriate roles. This
      typically involves changes at the application or system level, rather than at
      the infrastructure level.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the application or system.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the different roles and responsibilities within your application
      or system.
    - 2. Define the permissions and access levels required for each role.
    - 3. Implement a mechanism to assign roles to users or entities.
    - 4. Enforce access control based on the assigned roles and permissions.
    - 5. Regularly review and update roles and permissions as needed.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly implement Role-Based Access
    Control (RBAC). RBAC is a security principle that restricts system access to authorized
    users based on their assigned roles and permissions. It is typically implemented
    at the application or system level, rather than at the infrastructure level.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application or system has not implemented Role-Based Access Control
      (RBAC), increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security incidents.
    partial: The application or system has partially implemented Role-Based Access
      Control (RBAC), but there are gaps or inconsistencies that need to be addressed.
    success: The application or system has implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
      effectively, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security
      incidents.
  reason: While the EC2Resource does not directly implement RBAC, it provides some
    related capabilities that can be leveraged as part of an overall RBAC implementation.
    EC2 instances can be associated with IAM roles (iam_instance_profile), which can
    be used to grant specific permissions to the instance. Security groups can be
    used to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances, effectively controlling
    access based on network rules. However, these features alone do not constitute
    a complete RBAC implementation.
