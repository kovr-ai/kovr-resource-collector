    description: To ensure secure configuration of web servers, you need to review
      and harden the web server settings based on industry best practices and security
      guidelines.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial configuration review and hardening, ongoing
      maintenance required
    instructions:
    - Identify the web servers in your environment (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS).
    - Review the web server configuration files and settings.
    - Implement recommended security hardening measures, such as disabling unnecessary
      modules, restricting access, enabling secure protocols, and configuring appropriate
      logging.
    - Regularly update the web server software and apply security patches.
    - Monitor web server logs for potential security incidents.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate to the configuration
    of web servers. It provides information about AWS Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) policies, users, and access keys. While IAM is crucial for managing access
    to AWS resources, including web servers, it does not directly configure the web
    server settings themselves.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The web server configurations are insecure and do not meet the recommended
      security standards.
    partial: Some web server configurations are secure, but others require attention.
    success: The web server configurations are secure and follow industry best practices.
  reason: The security check 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-web-servers'
    specifically focuses on validating the secure configuration of web servers, such
    as Apache or Nginx. The IAMResource does not contain any information about web
    server configurations or settings.
