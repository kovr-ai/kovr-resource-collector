    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
      check. To address this security check, you would need to review and update the
      configurations of the relevant systems and services within your Google Cloud
      environment.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement this check will vary depending
      on the complexity and number of systems involved, as well as the existing processes
      and tools in place.
    instructions:
    - Identify the critical systems and services that require regular configuration
      reviews and updates.
    - Establish a process for periodically reviewing and updating the configurations
      of these systems and services.
    - Implement automated tools or scripts to assist with the review and update process,
      where applicable.
    - Document and maintain records of the configuration changes made during each
      review cycle.
    - Ensure that the updated configurations are thoroughly tested and validated before
      deployment.

  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    is designed to ensure that system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated
    to maintain a secure posture. However, the provided Google UserResource does not
    appear to be directly related to system configurations or their management. This
    resource represents user account information within the Google Workspace environment,
    including details such as user profile, contact information, and security settings.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The system configurations are not being regularly reviewed and updated,
      which can introduce security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    partial: Some system configurations are being reviewed and updated, but the process
      is not comprehensive or consistent.
    success: The system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated to maintain
      a secure posture.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any information related to system configurations
    or their review and update processes. It is primarily focused on storing and managing
    user account data within the Google Workspace environment.
