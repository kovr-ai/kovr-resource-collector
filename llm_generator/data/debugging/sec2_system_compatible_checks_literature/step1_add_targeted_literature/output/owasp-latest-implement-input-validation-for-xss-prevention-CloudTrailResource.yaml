    description: This security check is not applicable to CloudTrail. To prevent XSS
      attacks, input validation should be implemented in web applications that handle
      user input.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the number and complexity of web applications.
    instructions:
    - Identify web applications that accept user input and are susceptible to XSS
      attacks.
    - Implement input validation mechanisms, such as sanitizing and validating user
      input, to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Regularly update and patch web applications to address known XSS vulnerabilities.
    - Implement web application firewalls (WAFs) to provide an additional layer of
      protection against XSS attacks.
  is_valid: false
  literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related events
    for your account. It does not directly implement input validation or prevent Cross-Site
    Scripting (XSS) attacks, which are web application vulnerabilities. CloudTrail
    can be used to log and monitor API activity, but it does not provide XSS prevention
    mechanisms.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to log relevant API activity, and input
      validation is not implemented in web applications to prevent XSS attacks.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to log relevant API activity, but
      input validation is not fully implemented in web applications to prevent XSS
      attacks.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to log relevant API activity, and input validation
      is implemented in web applications to prevent XSS attacks.
  reason: CloudTrail is a logging and monitoring service that records API activity.
    It does not directly handle user input validation or prevent XSS attacks in web
    applications. The security check is focused on implementing input validation to
    prevent XSS, which is not a core function of CloudTrail.
