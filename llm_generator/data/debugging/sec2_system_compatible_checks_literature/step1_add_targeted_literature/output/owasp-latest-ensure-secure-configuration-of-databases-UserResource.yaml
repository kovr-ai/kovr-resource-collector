    description: 'Since the provided resource is not applicable for this security
      check, no specific fix details can be provided. However, to ensure secure configuration
      of databases, you should review and implement the following general guidelines:'
    estimated_time: The time required to implement these fixes will vary depending
      on the complexity of your database environment and the existing security measures
      in place.
    instructions:
    - Enable strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication
      or secure password policies.
    - Implement granular access controls and least privilege principles to restrict
      access to sensitive data.
    - Configure encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.
    - Enable auditing and logging mechanisms to track and monitor database activities.
    - Regularly review and update database configurations to align with the latest
      security best practices and vendor recommendations.

  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The database configurations are not secure and do not follow industry
      best practices, exposing sensitive data to potential unauthorized access or
      modification.
    partial: Some aspects of the database configurations are secure, but there are
      areas that need improvement to fully comply with industry best practices.
    success: The database configurations are secure and follow industry best practices
      for authentication, access controls, encryption, auditing, and logging.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any information related to database configurations,
    authentication mechanisms, access controls, encryption settings, auditing, or
    logging. It primarily stores user account details, contact information, and organizational
    data, which are not relevant for this security check.
