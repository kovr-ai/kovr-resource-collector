  literature: The OWASP latest secure authentication mechanisms check focuses on validating
    the implementation of secure authentication mechanisms within an application to
    protect against common authentication attacks. This includes measures such as
    proper credential handling, brute-force protection, and session management. However,
    the provided AWS S3 resource is an object storage service and does not directly
    handle authentication mechanisms for applications.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the OWASP latest secure authentication
      mechanisms check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the OWASP latest secure authentication
      mechanisms check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the OWASP latest secure authentication
      mechanisms check.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is an object storage service and does not directly implement
    authentication mechanisms for applications. While S3 does have access control
    mechanisms, it does not cover the specific authentication requirements outlined
    in the OWASP secure authentication mechanisms check.
