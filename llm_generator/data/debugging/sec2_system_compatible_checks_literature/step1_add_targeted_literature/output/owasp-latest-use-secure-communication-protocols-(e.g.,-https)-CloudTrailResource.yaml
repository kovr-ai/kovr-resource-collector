  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    focused on ensuring that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols like HTTPS to protect data in transit. This check is primarily applicable
    to resources that handle web traffic or network communication, such as load balancers,
    API gateways, or web servers. The AWS CloudTrail resource is a service that logs
    AWS account activity and does not directly handle web traffic or network communication
    protocols.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource is not applicable for the 'Use Secure Communication
      Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' check.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource is not applicable for the 'Use Secure Communication
      Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' check.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to log all account activity securely.
  reason: The AWS CloudTrail resource is a logging service that records AWS account
    activity and does not directly handle web traffic or network communication protocols.
    Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication
    Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)'.
