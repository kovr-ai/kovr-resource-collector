    description: To establish a comprehensive disaster recovery plan for AWS resources,
      you need to consider various services and components beyond IAM. This may include
      services like AWS Backup, Amazon EBS snapshots, Amazon RDS backups, AWS CloudFormation
      templates, and AWS Lambda functions for automating recovery processes.
    estimated_time: Establishing a comprehensive disaster recovery plan can take several
      weeks or months, depending on the complexity of your AWS infrastructure and
      the level of detail required.
    instructions:
    - Identify critical AWS resources and services that need to be included in the
      disaster recovery plan.
    - Define recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) for
      each critical resource.
    - Implement backup and replication strategies for data and configurations using
      services like AWS Backup, Amazon EBS snapshots, and Amazon RDS backups.
    - Create AWS CloudFormation templates or scripts to automate the provisioning
      and configuration of resources during recovery.
    - Develop and document detailed recovery procedures, including step-by-step instructions
      and responsible parties.
    - Regularly test and validate the disaster recovery plan to ensure its effectiveness.

  literature: The IAM (Identity and Access Management) resource in AWS is primarily
    used for managing user identities, access policies, and permissions within an
    AWS account. While IAM plays a crucial role in securing AWS resources, it does
    not directly address disaster recovery planning or business continuity measures.
    Establishing disaster recovery plans involves a broader scope that encompasses
    various aspects of an organization's infrastructure, data, and operations.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM resource is not applicable for establishing disaster recovery
      plans.
    partial: The IAM resource is not applicable for establishing disaster recovery
      plans.
    success: The IAM resource is not applicable for establishing disaster recovery
      plans.
  reason: The IAM resource does not contain information or configurations related
    to disaster recovery planning. Disaster recovery plans typically involve strategies,
    procedures, and resources for restoring critical systems, data, and operations
    in the event of a disruptive incident. While IAM can be used to manage access
    and permissions for disaster recovery resources, it does not directly implement
    or define the disaster recovery plan itself.
