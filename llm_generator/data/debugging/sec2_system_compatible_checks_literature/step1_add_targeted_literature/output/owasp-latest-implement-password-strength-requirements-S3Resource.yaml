  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-implement-password-strength-requirements'
    is focused on implementing strong password requirements as per the latest OWASP
    recommendations. This check is primarily applicable to resources that handle user
    authentication and password management, such as Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) services, user directories, or applications with user login functionality.
    The AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) resource provided is a highly scalable object
    storage service and does not directly handle user authentication or password management.

      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-password-strength-requirements'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-password-strength-requirements'
      security check.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not have any direct relation
    to user authentication or password management functionality. Therefore, it is
    not a valid resource for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-password-strength-requirements'
    security check.
