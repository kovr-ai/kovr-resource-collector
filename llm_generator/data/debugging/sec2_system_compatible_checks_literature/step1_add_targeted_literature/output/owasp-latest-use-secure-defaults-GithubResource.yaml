    description: To address this issue, you would need to review the configuration
      settings and defaults of the systems and applications hosted within the GitHub
      repository. This may involve examining the application code, configuration files,
      and deployment scripts to ensure that secure defaults are implemented.
    estimated_time: The estimated time can vary significantly depending on the complexity
      of the systems and applications involved, as well as the number of configurations
      that need to be reviewed and updated. It could range from a few hours for simple
      applications to several days or weeks for complex systems.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the systems and applications hosted within the GitHub repository.
    - 2. Review the configuration files and deployment scripts for each system and
      application.
    - 3. Ensure that unnecessary services are disabled, default accounts are removed,
      and security controls are configured according to best practices.
    - 4. Update the configurations as needed to implement secure defaults.
    - 5. Test and validate the changes to ensure that the systems and applications
      are functioning correctly with the secure defaults in place.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check is focused on ensuring
    that applications and systems are configured with secure default settings and
    configurations. This includes disabling unnecessary services, removing default
    accounts, and configuring security controls to meet best practices. The GitHub
    resource provided contains information about a GitHub repository, such as its
    branches, collaborators, security advisories, and vulnerability alerts. While
    this information is useful for understanding the security posture of the repository,
    it does not directly relate to the configuration of secure defaults for the underlying
    systems or applications.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The repository and its associated systems and applications are not configured
      with secure default settings.
    partial: Some components of the repository and its associated systems and applications
      are configured with secure default settings, while others are not.
    success: The repository and its associated systems and applications are configured
      with secure default settings.
  reason: The GitHub resource does not contain information about the configuration
    settings or defaults of the underlying systems or applications hosted on GitHub.
    It primarily provides metadata and details about the repository itself, rather
    than the configuration of the systems or applications within the repository.
