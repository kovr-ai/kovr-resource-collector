    description: This resource is not relevant for implementing password hashing.
      To address this security check, you should review the authentication mechanisms
      and password storage implementations within your applications or services that
      handle user credentials.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of your application architecture
      and the number of components involved.
    instructions:
    - Identify the components or services responsible for user authentication and
      credential management.
    - Review the password hashing algorithms and configurations used in these components.
    - Ensure that a secure and up-to-date password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt,
      scrypt, or Argon2) is implemented with appropriate cost factors and salting.
    - Update the password hashing implementation if necessary to comply with the security
      check.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of users,
    which is primarily used for managing access control and permissions. It does not
    directly relate to password hashing or authentication mechanisms. Password hashing
    is typically implemented within applications or services that handle user authentication
    and credential management.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for the owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing
      security check.
  reason: The GroupResource is not directly applicable for implementing the owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing
    security check, as it does not handle password storage or hashing algorithms.
    This resource is focused on managing user groups and their membership information.
