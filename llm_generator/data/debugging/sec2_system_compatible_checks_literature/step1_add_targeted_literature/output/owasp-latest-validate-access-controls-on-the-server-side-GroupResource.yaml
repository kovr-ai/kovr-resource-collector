    description: This check is not applicable to the Google GroupResource. To validate
      server-side access controls, you would need to analyze the server-side application
      code, configurations, and authentication/authorization mechanisms directly.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. This typically involves analyzing the server-side code, configurations,
    and authentication/authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users
    or entities can access and perform specific actions on protected resources or
    data. However, the Google GroupResource appears to be a resource representing
    a Google Group, which is a collection of users and other resources for collaboration
    and access management purposes. While access controls may be applied to Google
    Groups, this resource itself does not contain server-side application code or
    configurations that would be directly relevant for this check.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The server-side access controls are not properly implemented or validated,
      posing a security risk.
    partial: Some aspects of the server-side access controls are properly implemented
      and validated, but there are areas that need improvement.
    success: The server-side access controls are properly implemented and validated.
  reason: The Google GroupResource is a resource representing a Google Group, which
    is a collection of users and other resources for collaboration and access management
    purposes. It does not contain server-side application code or configurations that
    would be directly relevant for validating access controls on the server-side of
    an application.
