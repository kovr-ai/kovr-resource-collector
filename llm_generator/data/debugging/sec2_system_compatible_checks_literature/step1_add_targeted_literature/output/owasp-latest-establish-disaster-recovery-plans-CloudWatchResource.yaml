    description: To establish an adequate disaster recovery plan, the organization
      needs to undertake a comprehensive risk assessment, identify critical systems
      and data, define recovery objectives, and develop detailed procedures for restoring
      operations in the event of a disaster.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential disruptive events and their
      impact on the organization.
    - Prioritize critical systems, data, and operations that need to be recovered
      in the event of a disaster.
    - Define recovery objectives, such as Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery
      Point Objectives (RPOs), for each critical system and process.
    - Develop detailed procedures for data backup, system restoration, and failover
      to alternate sites or cloud environments.
    - Establish communication protocols and assign roles and responsibilities for
      disaster recovery teams.
    - Regularly test and validate the disaster recovery plan through simulations and
      drills.
    - Review and update the disaster recovery plan periodically to ensure its effectiveness
      and alignment with changing business requirements and technological landscape.

  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, such as creating alarms, dashboards, and log groups. While CloudWatch
    can be leveraged to monitor the health and availability of systems, it does not
    directly provide disaster recovery capabilities or establish disaster recovery
    plans. Establishing a comprehensive disaster recovery plan involves defining strategies,
    procedures, and resources for restoring critical operations, data, and systems
    in the event of a disaster, which goes beyond the scope of CloudWatch.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have an established disaster recovery plan
      or the existing plan is inadequate to address potential disruptive events and
      ensure business continuity.
    partial: The organization has a disaster recovery plan in place, but it lacks
      critical components or has not been thoroughly tested and validated.
    success: The organization has established and maintains a comprehensive disaster
      recovery plan that outlines strategies, procedures, and resources for restoring
      critical operations, data, and systems in the event of a disaster.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is focused on monitoring and observability,
    but does not directly address the establishment of disaster recovery plans, which
    is the primary objective of this security check.
