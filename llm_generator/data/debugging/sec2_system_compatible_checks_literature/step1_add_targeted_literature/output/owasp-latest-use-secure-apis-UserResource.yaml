    description: To address this issue, the application codebase and its dependencies
      need to be reviewed and updated to use the latest, secure versions of all APIs
      and libraries.
    estimated_time: Depending on the size and complexity of the application, this
      process could take several hours to several days.
    instructions:
    - Identify all APIs and libraries used in the application codebase.
    - Check for the latest secure versions of each API and library.
    - Update the application codebase to use the latest secure versions.
    - Conduct thorough testing to ensure compatibility and functionality after the
      updates.

  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check is focused on ensuring that applications
    use the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities
    introduced by outdated or insecure code. This check is primarily applicable to
    application code and the libraries/APIs used within the application codebase.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application uses outdated or insecure versions of APIs and libraries,
      increasing the risk of vulnerabilities and potential security incidents.
    partial: Some APIs and libraries used by the application are outdated or insecure,
      while others are up-to-date and secure. Partial risk of vulnerabilities exists.
    success: The application uses the latest, secure versions of all APIs and libraries,
      minimizing the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by outdated or insecure code.
  reason: The provided resource 'UserResource' appears to be a user account resource
    in Google Cloud, which does not directly relate to the application code or the
    libraries/APIs used within the application. This resource is not applicable for
    implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-apis' security check.
