  literature: Penetration testing is a simulated cyber attack against an organization's
    computer systems, networks, and web applications to identify vulnerabilities and
    weaknesses. While S3 buckets are cloud storage resources, they are not directly
    related to conducting penetration testing activities. Penetration testing typically
    involves assessing the security of applications, networks, and systems through
    various techniques such as vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and privilege
    escalation. S3 buckets are storage containers and do not have the necessary functionality
    or attack surface for comprehensive penetration testing.
