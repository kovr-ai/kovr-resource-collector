  literature: The GitHub resource provided does not contain any information related
    to logging mechanisms or audit trails. The resource fields primarily contain data
    about the repository itself, such as its metadata, branches, collaborators, actions
    workflows, and security advisories. However, there is no indication of how logging
    is implemented or managed within the repository or the GitHub platform.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub resource does not implement secure logging mechanisms or provide
      any information about logging capabilities.
    partial: The GitHub resource partially implements secure logging mechanisms, but
      lacks certain features or configurations to ensure comprehensive logging and
      audit trails.
    success: The GitHub resource implements secure logging mechanisms that capture
      relevant user activities, system events, and security-related occurrences, ensuring
      the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of log data.
  reason: The GitHub resource does not contain any relevant fields or data related
    to logging mechanisms or audit trails. The resource is focused on providing information
    about the repository itself, rather than the underlying infrastructure or platform
    logging capabilities.
