    description: 'To implement secure software supply chain practices, the organization
      should establish processes and controls across various stages of the software
      development lifecycle, including:'
    estimated_time: Implementing secure software supply chain practices is an ongoing
      effort that may take several months or longer, depending on the organization's
      size and complexity.
    instructions:
    - Implement secure coding practices and code review processes to identify and
      mitigate vulnerabilities in the source code.
    - Establish secure build processes, including the use of trusted build environments,
      artifact signing, and integrity checks.
    - Implement secure deployment processes, including the use of trusted repositories,
      secure communication channels, and deployment verification.
    - Implement continuous monitoring and incident response processes to detect and
      respond to potential supply chain attacks or compromises.
    - Provide training and awareness programs for developers, operations teams, and
      other stakeholders involved in the software supply chain.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a collection of
    entities, such as users or service accounts, that can be managed together. While
    this resource is useful for managing access and permissions, it does not directly
    relate to implementing secure software supply chain practices. Secure software
    supply chain practices involve processes and controls throughout the software
    development lifecycle, including source code management, build processes, artifact
    signing, and deployment controls.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented adequate processes and controls
      to ensure the security and integrity of their software supply chain.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented processes and controls for
      secure software supply chain practices, but there are gaps or areas that need
      improvement.
    success: The organization has implemented robust processes and controls to protect
      their software supply chain from potential threats and vulnerabilities.
  reason: The GroupResource is primarily used for managing access and permissions
    for a group of entities, but it does not provide functionality or configurations
    related to secure software supply chain practices. The security check focuses
    on implementing processes and controls for ensuring the integrity and security
    of software throughout its lifecycle, which is not directly addressed by this
    resource.
