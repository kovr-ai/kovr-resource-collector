    description: To implement secure software supply chain practices, you need to
      review and configure resources related to your software development and deployment
      processes, such as Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Binary Authorization, and
      Cloud Deployment Manager.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of your software supply chain and
      existing processes.
    instructions:
    - Implement secure coding practices and code reviews in your development process.
    - Use trusted sources for third-party dependencies and components.
    - Implement automated security testing and vulnerability scanning for your code
      and dependencies.
    - Sign and verify code artifacts using tools like Binary Authorization.
    - Configure secure deployment pipelines with access controls and audit logging.
    - Regularly monitor and update your software supply chain components for security
      vulnerabilities.

  output_statements:
    failure: The Google Cloud UserResource does not have secure software supply chain
      practices implemented.
    partial: The Google Cloud UserResource partially implements secure software supply
      chain practices.
    success: The Google Cloud UserResource has secure software supply chain practices
      implemented.
  reason: The UserResource is focused on storing user account data such as names,
    emails, and contact information. It does not contain any information or configurations
    related to software supply chain security practices, such as code signing, vulnerability
    scanning, or secure deployment pipelines.
