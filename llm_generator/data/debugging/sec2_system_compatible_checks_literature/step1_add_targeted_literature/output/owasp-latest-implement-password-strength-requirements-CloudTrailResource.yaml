    description: To implement password strength requirements in AWS, you should review
      and configure the appropriate password policies within IAM or other relevant
      services.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes
    instructions:
    - 1. Navigate to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
    - 2. Review and update the account-level password policy to meet the latest OWASP
      password strength recommendations.
    - 3. If applicable, review and update password policies for individual IAM users
      or roles.
    - 4. Ensure that other AWS services that require authentication (e.g., Amazon
      RDS, Amazon Redshift) have appropriate password strength requirements configured.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. It does not directly implement password strength requirements
    or authentication controls. Password policies and requirements are typically configured
    at the AWS account level or within specific services like AWS Identity and Access
    Management (IAM).
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not the appropriate resource for implementing password
      strength requirements.
    partial: CloudTrail can be used to audit and monitor password-related events,
      but it does not directly enforce password strength requirements.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to log all relevant events for monitoring password-related
      activities.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is focused on auditing and logging AWS API calls
    and events. It does not have any direct functionality or configuration related
    to password strength requirements or authentication mechanisms.
