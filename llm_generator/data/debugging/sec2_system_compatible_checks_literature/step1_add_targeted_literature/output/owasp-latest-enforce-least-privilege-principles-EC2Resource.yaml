    description: To enforce the principle of least privilege, you need to review and
      configure IAM policies, roles, and permissions for users, groups, and roles.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial review and configuration, ongoing maintenance
      as needed
    instructions:
    - Identify all users, groups, and roles in your AWS account and their associated
      permissions.
    - Review each user, group, and role to determine the minimum required permissions
      for their intended tasks.
    - Update IAM policies and roles to grant only the necessary permissions, removing
      any excessive or unnecessary permissions.
    - Implement regular reviews and audits to ensure that permissions remain aligned
      with the principle of least privilege as your environment evolves.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to enforcing the principle
    of least privilege. This resource provides information about EC2 instances, security
    groups, network interfaces, and other EC2-related resources, but it does not contain
    details about user permissions, roles, or access controls. To enforce least privilege,
    you would need to review and configure Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies,
    roles, and permissions for users, groups, and roles.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more users, roles, or processes have excessive permissions beyond
      what is required for their intended tasks, violating the principle of least
      privilege.
    partial: Some users, roles, or processes have excessive permissions, while others
      adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    success: All users, roles, and processes have the minimum required permissions
      to perform their intended tasks, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain information about user permissions, roles,
    or access controls, which are necessary for enforcing the principle of least privilege.
    This resource is focused on providing details about EC2 instances, networking,
    and related resources.
