    description: To address this security check, the organization needs to establish
      a formal process for regularly reviewing and updating its security policies.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks (depending on the number and complexity of policies)
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify all existing security policies and their respective owners or stakeholders.
    - 2. Define a review cycle (e.g., annually, bi-annually) for each policy based
      on its criticality and the organization's risk profile.
    - 3. Establish a cross-functional team or committee responsible for coordinating
      the review process and ensuring its consistent implementation.
    - 4. During the review process, assess the policies for gaps, outdated information,
      and alignment with industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and the
      organization's evolving security needs.
    - 5. Update the policies as necessary, following the organization's change management
      and approval processes.
    - 6. Communicate and disseminate the updated policies to all relevant stakeholders,
      and provide training or awareness sessions as needed.
    - 7. Document and maintain records of the review and update process for auditing
      and compliance purposes.

  literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related events
    for your account. While CloudTrail can be used to monitor and log security-related
    events, it does not directly relate to the review and update of security policies.
    This security check is focused on ensuring that an organization has a process
    in place to regularly review and update its security policies to address evolving
    threats, technological changes, and business requirements.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have a defined process for regularly reviewing
      and updating its security policies, leaving it vulnerable to emerging threats

    partial: The organization has a process for reviewing and updating security policies,
      but it is not consistently followed or does not address all relevant areas.
    success: The organization has a well-defined process for regularly reviewing and
      updating its security policies to address evolving threats, technological changes,
      and business requirements.
  reason: The AWS CloudTrail resource is not directly applicable for implementing

    CloudTrail is a logging and monitoring service, while this check is focused on
    the governance and management of security policies.
