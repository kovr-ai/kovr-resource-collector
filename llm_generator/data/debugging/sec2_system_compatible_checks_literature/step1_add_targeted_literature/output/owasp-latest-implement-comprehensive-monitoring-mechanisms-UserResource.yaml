    description: To fully implement comprehensive monitoring mechanisms, the organization
      needs to set up additional monitoring tools and configurations beyond just the
      UserResource.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Enable audit logging for Google Cloud services and configure log sinks to centralize
      logs
    - Deploy a security information and event management (SIEM) solution to collect
      and analyze logs from various sources
    - Implement network traffic monitoring and intrusion detection/prevention systems
    - Configure application monitoring and logging for critical applications
    - Establish monitoring processes and incident response procedures

  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' represents user account information
    in Google Workspace. While monitoring user activities and access is important
    for security, this resource alone does not provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities
    across the entire infrastructure, applications, and user interactions as required
    by the OWASP security check. To fully implement comprehensive monitoring mechanisms,
    additional resources and configurations would be needed, such as audit logging,
    network traffic monitoring, application monitoring, and security information and
    event management (SIEM) tools.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented comprehensive monitoring mechanisms
      that can track and log various activities across its infrastructure, applications,
      and user interactions.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented monitoring mechanisms, but
      they do not provide comprehensive coverage across all infrastructure, applications,
      and user interactions.
    success: The organization has implemented comprehensive monitoring mechanisms
      that can track and log various activities across its infrastructure, applications,
      and user interactions.
  reason: The UserResource contains limited information about user account details
    and login activities, but does not provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities
    across the entire infrastructure and applications as required by the security
    check.
