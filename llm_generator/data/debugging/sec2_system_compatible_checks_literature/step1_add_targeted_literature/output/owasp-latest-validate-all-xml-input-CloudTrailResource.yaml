  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check is designed
    to validate all XML input received by an application to prevent various types
    of XML-based attacks. However, the AWS CloudTrail resource is a service that logs
    AWS account activity related to actions across the AWS infrastructure. It does
    not directly handle XML input or process XML data. Therefore, this security check
    is not applicable to the CloudTrail resource.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource does not handle XML input validation, which is
      required by the 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource does not handle XML input validation, which is
      required by the 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to validate all XML input received
      by the application.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is a logging service that records AWS account activity.
    It does not directly handle XML input or process XML data, which is the focus
    of the 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check. As a result, this
    resource is not valid for implementing this specific security check.
