  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    designed to ensure that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect data in transit from unauthorized access,
    interception, and tampering. However, the provided Google Cloud resource 'GroupResource'
    appears to be related to managing Google Groups, which are user collections for
    collaboration and access control purposes. This resource does not seem to be directly
    related to configuring communication protocols or web application security.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols
      (e.g., HTTPS)' check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols
      (e.g., HTTPS)' check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols
      (e.g., HTTPS)' check.
  reason: The 'GroupResource' is not a resource that handles communication protocols
    or web application security configurations. It is primarily used for managing
    user groups and their membership details, which is not directly relevant to the
    OWASP check for secure communication protocols.
