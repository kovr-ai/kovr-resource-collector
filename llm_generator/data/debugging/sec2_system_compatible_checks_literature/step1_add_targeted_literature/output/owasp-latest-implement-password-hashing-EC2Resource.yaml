    description: To implement secure password hashing, you need to update the application
      code running on the EC2 instances or integrate with an authentication service
      that provides password hashing functionality.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the application complexity and existing authentication
      implementation.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the application or service responsible for user authentication and
      password management.
    - 2. Implement a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2
      within the application code or use a library/framework that provides this functionality.
    - 3. Ensure that the hashing algorithm is configured with appropriate cost factors
      and salting to increase the computational effort required to crack the hashed
      passwords.
    - 4. Store the hashed passwords securely in the application's database or storage
      system.
    - 5. Update the authentication flow to hash new passwords before storing them
      and verify hashed passwords during login attempts.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly handle password hashing or
    authentication mechanisms. Password hashing is typically implemented within the
    application code or services that manage user authentication, such as Amazon Cognito
    or custom authentication systems. EC2 instances are virtual machines that can
    run various applications, but they do not inherently provide password hashing
    functionality.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application running on the EC2 instances does not implement secure
      password hashing or uses an outdated or weak hashing algorithm.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The application running on the EC2 instances implements secure password
      hashing using a modern algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any fields or configurations related to
    password hashing or user authentication. It represents virtual machine instances
    and their associated resources like networking, storage, and security groups.
    Password hashing is a application-level concern that needs to be implemented within
    the code running on the EC2 instances or through separate authentication services.
