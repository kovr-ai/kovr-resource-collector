    description: To ensure encryption for data in transit, you need to configure encryption
      at the network level (e.g., VPN, load balancer) or within the applications/services
      running on the EC2 instances.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial assessment, potentially longer for implementation
      depending on the complexity of your environment.
    instructions:
    - Review the network configurations (VPNs, load balancers, etc.) and ensure that
      encryption is enabled and using strong protocols/ciphers.
    - Review the applications/services running on the EC2 instances and configure
      them to use encryption for data transmissions (e.g., HTTPS, TLS, etc.).
    - Implement centralized encryption policies and standards for all data transmissions
      within your organization.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly handle encryption for data
    in transit. Data encryption in transit is typically handled at the network level
    or by the applications/services running on the EC2 instances. The EC2Resource
    provides information about EC2 instances, networking components like security
    groups and network interfaces, but does not directly configure or manage encryption
    for data transmissions.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more data transmissions to and from the EC2 instances are not
      encrypted or are using weak encryption protocols/ciphers.
    partial: Some data transmissions to and from the EC2 instances are encrypted,
      but others are not or are using weak encryption.
    success: All data transmissions to and from the EC2 instances are encrypted using
      strong encryption protocols and ciphers.
  reason: While the EC2Resource provides details about EC2 instances, network interfaces,
    and security groups, it does not directly manage or configure encryption for data
    in transit. This security check is more applicable to network resources like VPNs,
    load balancers, or application-level configurations.
