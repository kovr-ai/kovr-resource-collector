  literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check is focused on ensuring
    that applications and systems are configured with secure default settings and
    configurations. This check is primarily applicable to resources that have configurable
    settings or options that can impact the security posture of the system or application.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to the EC2Resource.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the EC2Resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the EC2Resource.
  reason: The AWS EC2Resource does not appear to have any configurable settings or
    options that directly relate to secure default configurations. This resource represents
    information about EC2 instances, reserved instances, elastic IPs, and other EC2-related
    resources in an AWS account. While it provides valuable information about the
    EC2 environment, it does not contain any settings or configurations that can be
    checked for secure defaults.
