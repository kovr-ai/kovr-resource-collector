    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing encryption for data
      in transit. To address this security check, you should focus on resources that
      handle network communication and data transmission, such as load balancers,
      virtual machine instances, or networking configurations.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of your environment and the
      number of resources involved.
    instructions:
    - Identify resources in your Google Cloud environment that handle network communication
      and data transmission.
    - Review the encryption configurations for those resources to ensure proper encryption
      mechanisms are in place for data in transit.
    - Consult Google Cloud documentation and best practices for configuring encryption
      for specific resource types.

  literature: The Google GroupResource represents a group of users within an organization.
    It does not directly handle data transmission or encryption mechanisms. Therefore,
    this resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-in-transit'
    security check, which focuses on ensuring proper encryption for data transmitted
    over networks.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-in-transit'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-in-transit'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-in-transit'
      security check.
  reason: The GroupResource is a representation of a user group within an organization
    and does not directly handle network communication or data transmission. As such,
    it does not have any relevant fields or configurations related to implementing
    encryption for data in transit.
