  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check is designed
    to validate all XML input received by an application to prevent various types
    of XML-based attacks. However, the provided GithubResource does not appear to
    be an application that directly handles XML input. GitHub is a code hosting and
    collaboration platform, and the resource fields provided relate to repository
    metadata, actions, security data, and collaboration information, but do not contain
    any information about XML input handling or processing.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not validate XML input, leaving it vulnerable to
      XML-based attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application properly validates all XML input to prevent XML-based
      attacks.
  reason: The GithubResource does not seem to be an application that directly handles
    XML input, which is the focus of the 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security
    check. The resource fields provided relate to repository metadata, actions, security
    data, and collaboration information, but do not contain any information about
    XML input handling or processing.
