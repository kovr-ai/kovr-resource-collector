    description: To address this security check, the organization needs to develop
      and implement a comprehensive plan for vulnerability management.
    estimated_time: Developing and implementing a comprehensive vulnerability management
      plan can take several weeks or months, depending on the size and complexity
      of the organization.
    instructions:
    - Establish a vulnerability management policy that outlines the organization's
      approach to identifying, prioritizing, and addressing vulnerabilities.
    - Define roles and responsibilities for vulnerability management activities, including
      vulnerability scanning, risk assessment, and remediation.
    - Implement processes for regularly scanning applications and systems for vulnerabilities,
      using industry-standard tools and techniques.
    - Develop a risk-based approach for prioritizing and addressing identified vulnerabilities,
      considering factors such as severity, impact, and exploitability.
    - Establish procedures for testing and deploying security patches and updates
      in a timely and controlled manner.
    - Implement a process for monitoring and reporting on the status of vulnerability
      remediation efforts.
    - Regularly review and update the vulnerability management plan to ensure it remains
      effective and aligned with the organization's evolving needs and the changing
      threat landscape.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' security
    check is focused on ensuring that an organization has a documented plan for addressing
    vulnerabilities in their applications and systems. This check is primarily concerned
    with the organization's processes, policies, and procedures related to vulnerability
    management, rather than specific technical configurations or settings within a
    cloud resource.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have a documented plan for addressing vulnerabilities
      in their applications and systems.
    partial: The organization has a partially documented plan for addressing vulnerabilities,
      but it lacks key elements or is not regularly reviewed and updated.
    success: The organization has a well-defined and documented plan for addressing
      vulnerabilities in their applications and systems, which is regularly reviewed
      and updated.
  reason: The provided resource (EC2Resource) is an AWS EC2 resource that contains
    information about EC2 instances, security groups, VPCs, and other related components.
    While these resources are important for the overall security posture of an organization's
    cloud infrastructure, they do not directly address the requirement of having a
    documented plan for vulnerability management. This security check is more applicable
    to an organization's overall risk management and governance processes, rather
    than a specific cloud resource.
