    description: To properly implement the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events'
      check, you need to configure and enable logging for security-relevant events
      at the system or application level, rather than relying solely on S3 bucket
      logging.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance and review
    instructions:
    - Identify the appropriate logging mechanism for your system or application (e.g.,
      system logs, application logs, security information and event management (SIEM)
      solutions).
    - Configure the logging mechanism to capture and log security-relevant events,
      such as authentication attempts, access control decisions, system configuration
      changes, and other security-related activities.
    - Ensure that the logging mechanism captures relevant details, such as timestamps,
      user identities, source IP addresses, and event descriptions.
    - Implement log retention and rotation policies to ensure that log data is retained
      for the required period and is easily accessible for analysis and investigation.
    - Regularly review and analyze the log data to identify potential security incidents
      or anomalies.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. However, the AWS S3 resource provided does not directly
    relate to logging security-relevant events. S3 is an object storage service, and
    while it does have logging capabilities, it is primarily focused on storing and
    retrieving data objects rather than system-level logging.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The system is not properly logging security-relevant events, which may
      hinder incident response and forensic analysis capabilities.
    partial: The system is partially logging security-relevant events, but there may
      be gaps or limitations in the logging coverage.
    success: The system is properly logging security-relevant events, enabling effective
      incident response and forensic analysis.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is primarily used for object storage and does not directly
    handle system-level logging of security-relevant events. While S3 does have logging
    capabilities for tracking bucket-level events, it is not designed to capture and
    log security-relevant events across the entire system or application.
