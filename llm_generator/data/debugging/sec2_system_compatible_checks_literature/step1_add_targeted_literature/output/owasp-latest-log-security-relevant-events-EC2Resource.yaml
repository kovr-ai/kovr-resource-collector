    description: To implement this security check, you need to configure and enable
      logging for security-relevant events in your AWS environment. This typically
      involves setting up and configuring AWS CloudTrail, AWS CloudWatch Logs, and
      potentially other AWS services depending on your specific requirements.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 'Step 1: Enable AWS CloudTrail and configure it to capture and log relevant
      events across your AWS account.'
    - 'Step 2: Create and configure CloudWatch Log Groups and Log Streams to receive
      and store the logs generated by CloudTrail and other services.'
    - 'Step 3: Configure log retention policies and access controls to ensure logs
      are retained for the desired period and accessible only to authorized personnel.'
    - 'Step 4: Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to
      security-relevant events captured in the logs.'
    - 'Step 5: Regularly review and analyze the logs to identify potential security
      incidents or anomalies.'
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. However, the EC2Resource provided does not contain any
    information related to logging or auditing capabilities. This resource primarily
    deals with EC2 instances, networking components, and other infrastructure-level
    details.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource is not configured to log security-relevant events.
    partial: N/A
    success: The EC2 resource is properly configured to log security-relevant events.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any fields or configurations related to
    logging or auditing security events. This resource is focused on managing EC2
    instances, networking components, and other infrastructure-level details, but
    does not provide information about logging mechanisms or security event logging
    configurations.
