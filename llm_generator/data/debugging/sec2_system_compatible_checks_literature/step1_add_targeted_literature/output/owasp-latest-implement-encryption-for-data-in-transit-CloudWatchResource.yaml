    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing encryption for data
      in transit. To address this security check, you should focus on other AWS resources
      and services that handle data transmission, such as load balancers, API gateways,
      or VPC configurations.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement encryption for data in transit
      can vary depending on the complexity of your environment and the number of resources
      involved.
    instructions:
    - Identify the AWS resources and services that handle data transmission in your
      environment.
    - Review the encryption configurations and settings for those resources to ensure
      that appropriate encryption mechanisms are in place for data in transit.
    - Implement encryption for data in transit using AWS services like AWS Certificate
      Manager, AWS CloudFront, AWS API Gateway, or AWS Load Balancers, depending on
      your specific use case.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It does not directly handle data transmission or encryption
    of data in transit. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing
    the security check 'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-in-transit'.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is not responsible for transmitting data or implementing
    encryption mechanisms for data in transit. It is a monitoring and logging service
    that collects and stores log data and metrics from various AWS resources and applications.
