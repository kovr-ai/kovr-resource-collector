    description: To implement the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check,
      you need to configure logging and auditing services within AWS, such as CloudTrail,
      CloudWatch Logs, or AWS Security Hub.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture and log API activity across your AWS account.
    - Configure CloudWatch Logs to ingest and analyze log data from various AWS services.
    - Set up AWS Security Hub to centralize and analyze security findings from multiple
      AWS services.
    - Define appropriate log retention policies and access controls to ensure log
      data is securely stored and accessible for auditing purposes.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. However, the IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate
    to logging security events. This resource represents Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) policies, users, and access keys, which are used for managing authentication
    and authorization within AWS.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource does not support logging security-relevant events.
    partial: The IAMResource partially supports logging security-relevant events,
      but additional configuration is required.
    success: The IAMResource is configured to log security-relevant events effectively.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS does not contain information related to logging security-relevant
    events. It focuses on managing IAM policies, users, and access keys, which are
    used for authentication and authorization purposes, but do not directly handle
    logging or auditing of security events.
