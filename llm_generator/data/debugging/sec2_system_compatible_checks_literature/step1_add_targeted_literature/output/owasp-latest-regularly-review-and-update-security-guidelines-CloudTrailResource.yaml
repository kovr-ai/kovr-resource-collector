  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-guidelines'
    is focused on regularly reviewing and updating security guidelines based on the
    OWASP Top 10 standard for web application security. This check is primarily concerned
    with the processes and procedures for maintaining and updating security guidelines,
    rather than a specific cloud resource configuration.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization does not have a defined process for regularly reviewing
      and updating security guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10 standard.
    partial: N/A
    success: Your organization has a well-defined process for regularly reviewing
      and updating security guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10 standard.
  reason: The AWS CloudTrail resource is a service that records AWS API calls and
    related events for your account. While CloudTrail can be used to monitor and audit
    activities related to web applications, it does not directly address the process
    of reviewing and updating security guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10. Therefore,
    this resource is not directly applicable for implementing this specific security
    check.
