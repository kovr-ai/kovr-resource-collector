    description: To implement centralized log management, you need to use a dedicated
      log management solution or service that can collect, store, and analyze logs
      from various sources within your organization.
    estimated_time: The implementation time can vary depending on the size and complexity
      of your organization, but it typically takes several weeks to several months.
    instructions:
    - Evaluate and select a centralized log management solution that meets your organization's
      requirements.
    - Configure the log management solution to collect logs from different sources,
      such as servers, applications, network devices, and security tools.
    - Set up log forwarding or agents on the sources to send logs to the centralized
      log management system.
    - Define log retention policies and storage requirements based on your organization's
      needs and compliance requirements.
    - Implement log analysis and monitoring capabilities to detect security incidents,
      troubleshoot issues, and generate reports.
    - Integrate the log management solution with other security tools and processes
      for incident response and forensic investigations.

    to centralized log management. This resource primarily contains data about the
    GitHub repository itself, such as its metadata, branches, collaborators, actions
    workflows, security advisories, and vulnerability alerts. However, it does not
    provide any information about log collection, storage, or analysis from various
    sources within the organization.
