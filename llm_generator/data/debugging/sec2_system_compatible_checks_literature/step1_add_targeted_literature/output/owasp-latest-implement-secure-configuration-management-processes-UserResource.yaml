    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing this security check.
      To address this check, the organization should review its configuration management
      processes and ensure that they align with industry best practices and relevant
      compliance standards.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the organization's size and complexity.
    instructions:
    - Establish a formal process for tracking and documenting configuration changes
      to systems and applications.
    - Implement a testing and approval process for configuration changes before deployment.
    - Ensure that configuration changes are deployed in a controlled manner, with
      proper monitoring and rollback procedures in place.
    - Regularly review and update configuration management processes to address emerging
      threats and evolving best practices.

  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' from Google Cloud Platform appears
    to be related to user account management and does not directly address secure
    configuration management processes. This security check is focused on validating
    that organizations have implemented robust processes for managing configuration
    changes to systems and applications, including tracking, testing, approving, and
    deploying changes in a controlled manner. The UserResource does not contain information
    about configuration management processes or controls.

    failure: The organization has not implemented secure configuration management
      processes for tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes in a controlled
      manner.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The organization has implemented secure configuration management processes
      for tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes in a controlled manner.
