    description: This check is not directly applicable to the provided AWS S3 resource,
      as it focuses on the application codebase and the APIs/libraries used within
      it.

  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check is focused on ensuring that applications
    use the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities
    introduced by outdated or insecure code. This check is primarily applicable to
    application code and the libraries/APIs used within the application codebase.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application uses outdated or insecure versions of APIs and libraries,
      increasing the risk of vulnerabilities and potential security incidents.
    partial: Some components of the application use outdated or insecure versions
      of APIs and libraries, while others are up-to-date and secure.
    success: The application uses the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries,
      minimizing the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by outdated or insecure code.
  reason: The provided resource (AWS S3) is a storage service and does not directly
    relate to the use of APIs or libraries within application code. While S3 does
    provide APIs for interacting with the service, this check is more focused on the
    application-level APIs and libraries used in the application codebase itself,
    rather than the underlying cloud services.
