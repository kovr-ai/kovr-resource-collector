    description: This security check is not applicable to the IAMResource in AWS.
      To implement output encoding for XSS prevention, you need to focus on the web
      application code and ensure that user input is properly encoded before rendering
      it in web pages.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the size and complexity of the web application.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify all user input sources in the web application (e.g., form fields,
      URL parameters, cookies).
    - 2. Implement input validation and sanitization to remove or escape any potentially
      malicious characters or scripts.
    - 3. Use appropriate encoding functions or libraries to encode user input before
      rendering it in web pages.
    - 4. Test the web application thoroughly to ensure that XSS vulnerabilities have
      been mitigated.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing output
    encoding for XSS prevention. This security check is focused on ensuring that web
    applications properly encode user input before rendering it in web pages to prevent
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The IAMResource manages Identity and Access
    Management (IAM) policies, users, and access keys, which are not directly relevant
    to web application security or output encoding.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The web application does not properly implement output encoding, leaving
      it vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The web application properly implements output encoding to prevent XSS
      attacks.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS is used for managing IAM policies, users, and access
    keys, which are not directly related to implementing output encoding for XSS prevention
    in web applications. This security check is focused on ensuring that web applications
    properly encode user input before rendering it in web pages to prevent Cross-Site
    Scripting (XSS) attacks.
