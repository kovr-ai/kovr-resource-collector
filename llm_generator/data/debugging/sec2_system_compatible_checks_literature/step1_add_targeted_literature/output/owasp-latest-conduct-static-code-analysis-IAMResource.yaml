    description: This resource is not applicable for static code analysis. To implement
      this security check, you should focus on resources that contain application
      code or infrastructure as code (IaC) resources.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the size and complexity of the codebase.
    instructions:
    - Identify resources that contain source code or IaC artifacts within your AWS
      environment.
    - Configure static code analysis tools to scan these resources for vulnerabilities
      and coding best practices.
    - Establish a process to regularly scan and remediate issues identified by the
      static code analysis tool.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not contain any source code or information
    related to static code analysis. This resource is focused on managing Identity
    and Access Management (IAM) policies, users, and access keys within an AWS account.
    Static code analysis is typically performed on application code or infrastructure
    as code (IaC) resources, not IAM configurations.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource is not applicable for static code analysis.
    partial: The IAMResource does not contain any source code or artifacts suitable
      for static code analysis.
    success: The IAMResource has been successfully analyzed for static code analysis
      vulnerabilities.
  reason: The IAMResource does not contain any source code or artifacts that can be
    analyzed using static code analysis tools. This resource is focused on managing
    access and permissions within an AWS account, which is not directly related to
    the OWASP static code analysis security check.
