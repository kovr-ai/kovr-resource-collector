    description: To address this security check, the organization should focus on
      its software development processes, coding standards, and security controls
      implemented within the codebase itself.
    estimated_time: Implementing secure coding practices is an ongoing process that
      requires continuous effort and commitment from the organization.
    instructions:
    - Establish secure coding guidelines and standards based on industry best practices
      (e.g., OWASP Secure Coding Practices, CERT Secure Coding Standards).
    - Implement security controls and techniques to prevent common coding vulnerabilities
      such as input validation, output encoding, secure authentication and authorization
      mechanisms, and secure handling of sensitive data.
    - Conduct regular code reviews and static code analysis to identify and remediate
      security vulnerabilities.
    - Provide secure coding training and awareness programs for developers.
    - Integrate security testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)
      into the software development lifecycle.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-coding-practices'
    focuses on validating the adoption and enforcement of secure coding practices
    throughout the software development lifecycle. This includes following industry-standard
    guidelines, using secure coding techniques, and implementing security controls
    to prevent common coding vulnerabilities. However, the provided Google UserResource
    appears to be related to user account management and does not directly address
    secure coding practices.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure coding practices throughout
      its software development lifecycle, leaving its applications vulnerable to common
      coding vulnerabilities.
    partial: N/A
    success: The organization has implemented secure coding practices throughout its
      software development lifecycle, following industry-standard guidelines and implementing
      security controls to prevent common coding vulnerabilities.
  reason: The UserResource is a data structure representing user account information
    and does not contain any fields or properties related to secure coding practices,
    software development processes, or security controls implemented in the codebase.
    As such, this resource is not applicable for implementing the given security check.
