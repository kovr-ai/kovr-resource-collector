    description: To ensure compliance with data protection regulations and industry
      standards, S3 bucket configurations may need to be updated to enable encryption,
      restrict public access, and implement other necessary controls.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the number of buckets and
      the extent of configuration changes required.
    instructions:
    - Review the S3 bucket configurations and identify any buckets that do not have
      encryption enabled or have public access allowed.
    - For buckets without encryption, enable server-side encryption using AWS-managed
      keys (SSE-S3) or customer-managed keys (SSE-KMS).
    - For buckets with public access allowed, enable the public access block settings
      to restrict public access.
    - Implement additional controls as required by specific data protection regulations
      or industry standards, such as access logging, versioning, and lifecycle policies.
    - Monitor and regularly review S3 bucket configurations to ensure ongoing compliance.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations' check is designed
    to ensure that AWS S3 buckets comply with data protection regulations and industry
    standards when handling sensitive information. S3 buckets can store various types
    of data, including personal or sensitive information, which may be subject to
    regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This check helps organizations identify potential
    areas of non-compliance in their S3 bucket configurations and take appropriate
    measures to protect sensitive data and maintain regulatory compliance.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The S3 bucket configurations do not comply with data protection regulations
      and industry standards for handling sensitive information. Sensitive data may
      be at risk of unauthorized access or mishandling.
    partial: Some S3 bucket configurations comply with data protection regulations
      and industry standards for handling sensitive information, but others do not.
      Sensitive data may be at risk of unauthorized access or mishandling in non-compliant
      buckets.
    success: The S3 bucket configurations comply with data protection regulations
      and industry standards for handling sensitive information.
  reason: AWS S3 buckets can store sensitive data, and their configurations directly
    impact data protection and compliance with regulations. The provided field paths
    allow for checking encryption settings, public access controls, and other relevant
    configurations that determine compliance with data protection regulations.
