  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
    is focused on preventing XML External Entity (XXE) attacks by disabling external
    entity processing in applications that parse XML input. This check is typically
    applicable to web applications, APIs, or services that handle XML data and need
    to ensure that external references and entities are not resolved, which could
    lead to sensitive data exposure, remote code execution, or denial of service attacks.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource handles XML parsing or processing, and external entity processing
      is not disabled, leaving it vulnerable to XXE attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The resource does not handle XML parsing or processing, and therefore,
      the risk of XXE attacks is not applicable.
  reason: The provided resource 'GithubResource' appears to be related to GitHub repositories
    and their associated data, such as actions, collaborators, organizations, and
    security information. Based on the available field paths, there is no indication
    that this resource handles XML parsing or processing. Therefore, this resource
    is not directly applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
    security check.
