    description: This security check is not applicable to the IAMResource in AWS.
      Password recovery mechanisms should be implemented within the application or
      service that handles user authentication and account management.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the application or service.
    instructions:
    - Review the application or service responsible for user authentication and account
      management.
    - Ensure that secure password recovery mechanisms are implemented, such as sending
      password reset links to verified email addresses or using security questions.
    - Follow best practices for password recovery, such as requiring multi-factor
      authentication for sensitive account changes and implementing rate-limiting
      to prevent brute-force attacks.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly handle password recovery mechanisms
    for user accounts. It is primarily used for managing AWS Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) policies, users, and access keys. Password recovery mechanisms are typically
    implemented within the application or service that handles user authentication
    and account management.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource does not handle password recovery mechanisms.
    partial: The IAMResource does not directly handle password recovery mechanisms,
      but related user and access key management is implemented securely.
    success: The IAMResource has secure password recovery mechanisms implemented.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS is not directly responsible for implementing password
    recovery mechanisms. It manages IAM policies, users, and access keys, but does
    not handle the application-level functionality of password recovery.
