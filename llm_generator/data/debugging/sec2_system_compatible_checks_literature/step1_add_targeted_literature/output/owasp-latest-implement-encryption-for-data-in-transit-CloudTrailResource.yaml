    description: To implement encryption for data in transit, you need to ensure that
      all sensitive data transmitted over networks is properly encrypted using secure
      protocols and algorithms.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify all data flows and transmission channels within your application or
      system.
    - Implement secure protocols like TLS/SSL for web traffic and secure protocols
      like SSH or VPN for remote access.
    - Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) and key lengths (at least 128
      bits).
    - Regularly update and patch encryption libraries and protocols to address vulnerabilities.
    - Implement secure key management practices, including key rotation and secure
      storage.

  literature: The CloudTrail resource in AWS is used for logging and monitoring API
    activity across various AWS services. While it is an important security tool,
    it does not directly implement encryption for data in transit. The security check
    'owasp-latest-implement-encryption-for-data-in-transit' specifically focuses on
    ensuring that sensitive data transmitted over networks is properly encrypted to
    prevent unauthorized access or interception. CloudTrail logs events and API calls,
    but it does not handle the encryption of data during transmission.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Data in transit is not encrypted or is using insecure encryption methods,
      leaving it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.
    partial: Some data in transit is encrypted, but other transmissions are unencrypted
      or using weak encryption methods.
    success: Data in transit is properly encrypted using secure protocols and algorithms.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and auditing purposes,
    and does not directly handle the encryption of data in transit. This security
    check is focused on ensuring that data transmitted over networks is properly encrypted,
    which is typically implemented at the application or network level, rather than
    through a logging service like CloudTrail.
