    description: To implement RBAC, the application or system must define user roles
      and permissions based on business requirements, and enforce access control based
      on these roles and permissions.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify and define user roles based on job functions and access requirements.
    - Assign permissions to each role based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Implement a mechanism to authenticate users and assign them to the appropriate
      roles.
    - Enforce access control rules based on the user's assigned role and permissions.
    - Regularly review and update roles and permissions as business requirements change.

  literature: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service that provides object storage
    capabilities. While S3 supports access control mechanisms like bucket policies
    and Access Control Lists (ACLs), it does not natively implement Role-Based Access
    Control (RBAC) as defined by the security check. RBAC is typically implemented
    at the application or system level, where user roles and permissions are defined
    and enforced based on the application's business logic and access requirements.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application or system has not implemented Role-Based Access Control
      (RBAC), increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security incidents.
    partial: The application or system has partially implemented Role-Based Access
      Control (RBAC), but there are gaps or inconsistencies that need to be addressed.
    success: The application or system has implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
      effectively, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security
      incidents.
  reason: The S3 resource is a storage service and does not directly implement application-level
    RBAC. While it supports access control mechanisms like bucket policies and ACLs,
    it does not natively define and enforce user roles and permissions based on business
    logic and access requirements.
