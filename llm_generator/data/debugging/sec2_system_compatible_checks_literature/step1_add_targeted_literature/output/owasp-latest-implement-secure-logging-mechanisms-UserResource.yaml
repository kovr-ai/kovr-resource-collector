    description: To implement secure logging mechanisms in Google Cloud, you need
      to configure various logging services and resources based on your specific requirements.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for basic logging setup, more time required for advanced
      configurations and integrations.
    instructions:
    - Identify the Google Cloud services and resources that require logging, such
      as Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
    - Set up log sinks to export logs from different services to a centralized location,
      such as Cloud Storage or BigQuery.
    - Configure log retention policies to ensure logs are kept for the desired duration
      based on compliance and auditing needs.
    - Implement access controls and encryption for log data to maintain confidentiality
      and integrity.
    - Set up log-based metrics and alerts to monitor for security events and anomalies.
    - Integrate logging with security information and event management (SIEM) tools
      for centralized log analysis and correlation.

  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' represents user information in
    Google Workspace, including details like name, email, contact information, and
    organizational details. While this resource contains some audit-related information
    like creation time and last login time, it does not directly relate to implementing
    secure logging mechanisms for capturing system events, user activities, and security
    incidents as described in the security check.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Secure logging mechanisms are not properly configured in the Google Cloud
      environment, posing risks to audit trails and incident response capabilities.
    partial: Some aspects of secure logging are implemented, but additional configurations
      are needed for comprehensive logging and auditing.
    success: The Google Cloud environment has secure logging mechanisms implemented
      according to best practices.
  reason: The UserResource is focused on storing user account data rather than configuring
    or managing logging mechanisms within Google Cloud services. Implementing secure
    logging typically involves setting up log sinks, log exports, log retention policies,
    and access controls for log data, which is not covered by this resource.
