    description: If the check fails or partially passes, it indicates that access
      controls for the UserResource are not properly implemented on the server-side.
      This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security vulnerabilities.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review and update server-side access control mechanisms to ensure that only
      authorized users or entities can access and perform specific actions on protected
      user data.
    - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) based on the user's administrative
      privileges, organizational unit, and security settings.
    - Validate user identities and permissions before allowing access to sensitive
      user data or performing critical operations.
    - Regularly review and audit access control policies and configurations to identify
      and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    for the Google UserResource. This resource contains information about a user's
    account, including administrative privileges, contact details, and security settings.
    Proper access controls are crucial to ensure that only authorized users or entities

  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Access controls for the UserResource are not properly implemented on
      the server-side, allowing unauthorized users to access or modify sensitive user
      data.
    partial: Access controls for the UserResource are partially implemented on the
      server-side, but some issues were identified that could allow unauthorized access
      or modification of user data.
    success: Access controls for the UserResource are properly implemented on the
      server-side, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify user
      data based on their assigned roles and permissions.
  reason: The UserResource contains fields related to user privileges, identities,
    and security settings, which are essential for implementing proper access controls
    on the server-side. By validating these fields, the security check can ensure
    that only authorized users can access and modify user data based on their assigned
    roles and permissions.
