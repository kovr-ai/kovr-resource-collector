    description: If CloudTrail is not properly configured, you may need to create
      or update CloudTrail trails, event selectors, and insight selectors to capture
      and monitor relevant events.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - 1. Review your existing CloudTrail trails and ensure they are configured to
      capture the desired events.
    - 2. Configure event selectors to include management events, data events, and
      insights events relevant to your organization's security requirements.
    - 3. Enable log file validation and configure CloudTrail to deliver logs to a
      secure S3 bucket for long-term retention and analysis.
    - 4. Set up CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Alarms to monitor and alert on specific
      events or patterns of interest.
    - 5. Integrate CloudTrail with other security tools, such as SIEM solutions or
      security analytics platforms, for advanced analysis and correlation of events.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is highly applicable for implementing the
    'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' security check. CloudTrail is
    a service that records AWS API calls and related events, providing a comprehensive
    audit trail of activities across your AWS account. By configuring CloudTrail trails
    and event selectors, you can capture and monitor various types of events, including
    management events, data events, and insights events. This allows you to detect
    and investigate suspicious or anomalous activities within your AWS environment,
    such as unauthorized access attempts, policy changes, or data exfiltration.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to capture and monitor relevant events,
      hindering the ability to detect suspicious activities within your AWS environment.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to capture and monitor relevant events,
      but additional configuration is required to fully implement the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
      security check.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to capture and monitor relevant events, enabling
      the detection of suspicious activities within your AWS environment.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
    for AWS API calls and events, allowing you to detect and investigate suspicious
    or anomalous activities within your AWS environment. By configuring CloudTrail
    trails, event selectors, and insight selectors, you can capture and analyze various
    types of events, including management events, data events, and insights events,
    which are essential for implementing the 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities'
    security check.
