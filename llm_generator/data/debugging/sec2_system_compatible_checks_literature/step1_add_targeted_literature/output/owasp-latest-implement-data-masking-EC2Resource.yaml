    description: To implement data masking for sensitive data in your AWS environment,
      you need to configure it within the applications or databases running on the
      EC2 instances.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of the applications and databases
      involved.
    instructions:
    - Identify the applications or databases that handle sensitive data.
    - Implement data masking techniques within the application or database, such as
      substitution, encryption, or tokenization.
    - Test the data masking implementation to ensure sensitive data is properly obfuscated.
    - Monitor and maintain the data masking implementation as part of your security
      practices.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly handle data masking or encryption
    of sensitive data. Data masking is typically implemented at the application or
    database level, where sensitive data is stored and processed. While EC2 instances
    can host applications that perform data masking, the EC2 resource itself does
    not provide this functionality.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 instances and related resources do not have data masking implemented
      for sensitive data.
    partial: Some EC2 instances or related resources have data masking implemented,
      while others do not.
    success: The EC2 instances and related resources are configured to support data
      masking at the application or database level.
  reason: The EC2Resource represents EC2 instances, networking components, and related
    resources in an AWS account. It does not contain any fields or configurations
    related to data masking or encryption of sensitive data. Data masking is a security
    control that needs to be implemented within the applications or databases running
    on the EC2 instances.
