    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities'
      check. To address this security check, you should review and document your organization's
      vulnerability management processes, including procedures for identifying, prioritizing,
      and remediating vulnerabilities.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the size and complexity of the organization.
    instructions:
    - 1. Establish a vulnerability management policy that outlines the roles, responsibilities,
      and processes for addressing vulnerabilities.
    - 2. Implement a vulnerability scanning and reporting mechanism to identify and
      track vulnerabilities in your applications and systems.
    - 3. Define a risk-based approach for prioritizing and remediating vulnerabilities
      based on their severity and potential impact.
    - 4. Develop and maintain a vulnerability remediation plan that includes timelines,
      assigned responsibilities, and tracking mechanisms.
    - 5. Regularly review and update the vulnerability management plan to ensure it
      remains effective and aligned with industry best practices.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' check
    is designed to ensure that organizations have a well-defined and documented plan
    for addressing vulnerabilities discovered in their applications and systems. This
    check is typically applicable to resources that are directly related to vulnerability
    management processes, such as security policies, incident response plans, or vulnerability
    scanning tools.

  reason: The Google GroupResource is a resource that represents a group within the
    Google Workspace environment. It is primarily used for managing user groups and
    their memberships. This resource does not appear to be directly related to vulnerability
    management processes or the implementation of a plan for addressing vulnerabilities.
    Therefore, it is not a valid resource for implementing this specific security
    check.
