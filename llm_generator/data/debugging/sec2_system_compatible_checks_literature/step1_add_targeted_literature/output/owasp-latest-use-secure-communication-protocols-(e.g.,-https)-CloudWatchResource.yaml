  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    designed to ensure that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols like HTTPS to protect data in transit. However, the AWS CloudWatch resource
    provided is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics,
    logs, and alarms. It does not directly handle web application communication or
    data transmission over the internet.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols
      (e.g., HTTPS)' security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols
      (e.g., HTTPS)' security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols
      (e.g., HTTPS)' security check.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is not directly applicable for implementing
    the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' security check. CloudWatch
    is a monitoring service and does not handle web application communication or data
    transmission over the internet. This security check is more relevant for resources
    like Elastic Load Balancers, API Gateways, or other web-facing services that handle
    incoming and outgoing traffic.
