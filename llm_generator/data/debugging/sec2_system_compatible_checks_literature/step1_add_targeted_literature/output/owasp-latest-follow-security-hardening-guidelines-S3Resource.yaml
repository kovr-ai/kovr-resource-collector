    description: S3 buckets that are not configured according to the OWASP security
      hardening guidelines need to be updated.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - Enable encryption on S3 buckets that do not have it enabled.
    - Disable public access on S3 buckets by configuring the public access block settings.
    - Review and update access controls and policies on S3 buckets to restrict access
      only to authorized users and services.
  is_valid: true
  literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide recommendations for
    securing S3 buckets, such as enabling encryption, disabling public access, and
    configuring access controls. Implementing these guidelines on S3 buckets can help
    mitigate risks like data breaches, unauthorized access, and data tampering.

      guidelines, but others are not.
    success: The S3 buckets are configured according to the OWASP security hardening
      guidelines.
  reason: S3 buckets store data and can be configured with various security controls.
    Implementing OWASP hardening guidelines on S3 buckets helps secure the data stored
    in them.
