    description: This security check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource. To
      implement secure coding practices, organizations should focus on resources related
      to the software development lifecycle, such as code repositories, build pipelines,
      and application deployment resources.

  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-coding-practices'
    focuses on secure coding practices during the software development lifecycle.
    However, the AWS S3 resource is a storage service for hosting and managing data,
    and does not directly relate to the implementation of secure coding practices
    within an application or codebase.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure coding practices throughout
      its software development lifecycle, leaving applications and codebases vulnerable
      to common coding vulnerabilities.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The organization has implemented secure coding practices throughout its
      software development lifecycle, following industry-standard guidelines and security
      controls to prevent common coding vulnerabilities.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not directly involve the
    implementation of secure coding practices within an application or codebase. This
    security check is more applicable to resources related to the software development
    lifecycle, such as code repositories, build pipelines, or application deployment
    resources.
