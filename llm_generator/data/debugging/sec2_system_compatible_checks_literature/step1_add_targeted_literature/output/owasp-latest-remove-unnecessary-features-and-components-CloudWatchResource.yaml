  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'
    is primarily focused on identifying and removing unnecessary features, components,
    or functionality from applications and systems. This check aims to reduce the
    attack surface and potential entry points for malicious actors by eliminating
    unnecessary elements that could introduce security vulnerabilities. However, the
    AWS CloudWatch resource provided does not directly relate to application or system
    components. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects
    and analyzes metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources and applications.
