    description: To implement this security check, you need to integrate the latest
      version of the OWASP static code analysis tool into your application's build
      pipeline or development process.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance as needed
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the appropriate OWASP static code analysis tool for your application's
      programming language(s) and framework(s).
    - 2. Install and configure the selected tool according to the provided documentation.
    - 3. Integrate the tool into your application's build pipeline or development
      process, ensuring that all source code is analyzed during each build or commit.
    - 4. Review the tool's output and address any identified vulnerabilities or coding
      issues according to best practices.
    - 5. Establish a process for regularly updating the static code analysis tool
      to the latest version to ensure that new vulnerabilities and coding issues are
      detected.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to conducting static
    code analysis on application source code. Static code analysis is typically performed
    on the application code itself, rather than on cloud infrastructure resources
    like EC2 instances. The provided field paths for the EC2Resource contain information
    about EC2 instances, networking components, and other infrastructure details,
    but do not include any information about application code or static analysis tools.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application's source code is not being analyzed using the latest
      version of the OWASP static code analysis tool. Potential vulnerabilities and
      coding issues may be present.
    partial: Some parts of the application's source code are being analyzed using
      the latest version of the OWASP static code analysis tool, but other parts are
      not being analyzed or are using an outdated version of the tool.
    success: The latest version of the OWASP static code analysis tool has been successfully
      integrated into the application's build pipeline, and all source code is being
      analyzed for potential vulnerabilities and coding issues.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any information related to application
    source code or static code analysis tools. Static code analysis is a process performed
    on the application code itself, not on cloud infrastructure resources.
