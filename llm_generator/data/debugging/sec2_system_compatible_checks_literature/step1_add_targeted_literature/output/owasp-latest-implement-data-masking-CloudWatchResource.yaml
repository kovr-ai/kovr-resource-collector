  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS does not directly handle sensitive data
    or provide data masking capabilities. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability
    service that collects and analyzes metrics, logs, and events from various AWS
    resources and applications. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor and alert
    on security-related events, it does not have built-in functionality for data masking
    or obfuscation.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource is not applicable for implementing data masking.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource is not applicable for implementing data masking.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is not applicable for implementing data masking.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, and does not directly handle or store sensitive data that requires data
    masking or obfuscation. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-data-masking'
    security check.
