    description: Since the GithubResource is not directly applicable to this security
      check, there are no specific remediation steps to provide. However, organizations
      should ensure that they have a comprehensive vulnerability management plan in
      place, which should be documented and regularly reviewed. This plan should cover
      the processes for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities
      across all applications, systems, and infrastructure components.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' security
    check is designed to ensure that organizations have a documented plan for addressing
    vulnerabilities discovered in their applications and systems. This check is typically
    applicable to resources that are directly involved in the development, deployment,
    and maintenance of applications or systems, such as code repositories, continuous
    integration/deployment pipelines, or infrastructure-as-code resources.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have a documented plan for addressing vulnerabilities
      discovered in their applications and systems.
    partial: N/A
    success: The organization has a well-defined and documented plan for addressing
      vulnerabilities discovered in their applications and systems.
  reason: The provided GithubResource does not appear to be directly related to the
    development, deployment, or maintenance of applications or systems. It primarily
    contains metadata and information about the GitHub repository itself, such as
    collaborators, branches, and webhooks. While some security-related data is present
    (e.g., code scanning alerts, vulnerability alerts), there is no indication of
    a documented plan or process for addressing these vulnerabilities. Therefore,
    this resource is not considered valid for implementing the 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities'
    security check.
