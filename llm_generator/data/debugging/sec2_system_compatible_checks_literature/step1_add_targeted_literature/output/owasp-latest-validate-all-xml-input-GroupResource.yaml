  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check is designed
    to validate XML input received by an application to prevent XML-based attacks
    such as XXE, XML injection, and other vulnerabilities. This check is typically
    implemented within the application code or through a web application firewall
    (WAF) that inspects incoming XML payloads.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application or WAF does not properly validate XML input, leaving
      it vulnerable to potential XML-based attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application or WAF successfully validates all incoming XML input
      to prevent XML-based attacks.
  reason: The provided resource 'GroupResource' from Google Cloud Platform appears
    to be related to managing groups and group memberships within an organization.
    Based on the available information, this resource does not seem to handle XML
    input or have any direct relation to validating XML data. Therefore, it is not
    applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security
    check.
