    description: If encryption for data in transit is not enabled or is using an insecure
      encryption type, it needs to be configured properly.
    estimated_time: 10 minutes
    instructions:
    - 1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    - 2. Select the bucket for which you want to enable encryption for data in transit.
    - 3. Go to the 'Properties' tab and click on 'Default encryption'.
    - 4. Enable 'AWS-managed key (SSE-S3)' or 'AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS)'
      encryption for data in transit.
    - 5. Save the changes to apply the encryption configuration.

  literature: The S3 resource in AWS is applicable for implementing encryption for
    data in transit as per the OWASP security check. S3 buckets can be configured
    to enforce encryption of data in transit using SSL/TLS when transferring data
    over the network. This ensures that all data transmitted to and from the S3 bucket
    is encrypted, protecting it from unauthorized access or interception.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The S3 bucket does not have encryption for data in transit enabled or
      is using an insecure encryption type.
    partial: Some S3 buckets have encryption for data in transit enabled, while others
      do not.
    success: The S3 bucket has encryption for data in transit enabled using a secure
      encryption type.
  reason: The S3 resource provides configuration options to enable encryption for
    data in transit using SSL/TLS. The relevant field paths are buckets[].encryption.enabled
    and buckets[].encryption.type, which allow specifying if encryption is enabled
    and the type of encryption used.
