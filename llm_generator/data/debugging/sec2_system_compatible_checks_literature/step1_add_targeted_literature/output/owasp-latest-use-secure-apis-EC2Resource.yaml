    description: To address this security check, you need to review the application
      codebase and identify all third-party APIs and libraries used. Then, ensure
      that the latest, secure versions of these APIs and libraries are being used,
      and update any outdated or insecure versions.
    estimated_time: The time required to fix this issue will depend on the size and
      complexity of the application codebase, as well as the number of third-party
      APIs and libraries used. It could range from a few hours for a small application
      to several days or weeks for a large, complex application.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify all third-party APIs and libraries used in the application codebase.
    - 2. Check the latest available versions of these APIs and libraries for security
      updates and bug fixes.
    - 3. Update the application codebase to use the latest, secure versions of the
      identified APIs and libraries.
    - 4. Implement a process to regularly monitor and update third-party APIs and
      libraries used in the application.

  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check is focused on ensuring that applications
    use the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities
    introduced by outdated or insecure code. This check is primarily applicable to
    application code and the libraries/APIs used within the application codebase.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application uses outdated or insecure versions of APIs and libraries,
      increasing the risk of known vulnerabilities and potential security incidents.
    partial: Some APIs and libraries used by the application are outdated or insecure,
      while others are up-to-date and secure. Partial compliance with the OWASP latest
      use secure APIs check.
    success: The application uses the latest, secure versions of all APIs and libraries,
      minimizing the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by outdated or insecure code.
  reason: The provided resource (EC2Resource) is an AWS EC2 resource, which represents
    Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, security groups, network interfaces, and
    other related resources. This resource does not contain information about the
    application code or the libraries/APIs used within the application. Therefore,
    it is not directly applicable for implementing the OWASP latest use secure APIs
    check.
