  literature: The 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations' check is designed
    to ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA when
    handling sensitive personal data. However, the AWS CloudWatch resource provided
    does not directly handle or store personal data. CloudWatch is a monitoring and
    observability service that collects and analyzes metrics, logs, and events from
    other AWS resources and applications. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor
    resources that handle personal data, it does not inherently contain or process
    that data itself.
