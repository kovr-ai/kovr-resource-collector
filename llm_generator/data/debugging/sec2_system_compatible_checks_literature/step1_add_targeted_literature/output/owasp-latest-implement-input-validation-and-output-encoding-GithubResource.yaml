    description: Since the GithubResource is not an application resource, there are
      no specific fixes required for this security check. However, if you are developing
      applications that handle user input and generate output, it is crucial to implement
      input validation and output encoding to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
    estimated_time: The time required for implementing input validation and output
      encoding can vary depending on the size and complexity of your application,
      but it is a critical security measure that should be prioritized.
    instructions:
    - Identify all points in your application where user input is accepted (e.g.,
      form fields, API endpoints, etc.)
    - Implement input validation mechanisms to sanitize and validate user input before
      processing it
    - Ensure that any user-supplied data is properly encoded before being rendered
      in the application's output (e.g., web pages, API responses, etc.)
    - Follow secure coding practices and use appropriate libraries or frameworks for
      input validation and output encoding
    - Regularly test and review your application for potential vulnerabilities related
      to input validation and output encoding
  is_valid: false
  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-and-output-encoding'
    focuses on ensuring that user input is properly validated and sanitized before
    being processed by an application, and that any user-supplied data is properly
    encoded before being rendered in the application's output. This is a critical
    security measure to prevent various types of code injection attacks, such as Cross-Site
    Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Command Injection. However, the provided resource
    'GithubResource' appears to be a data resource that retrieves information from
    GitHub repositories, organizations, and related entities. It does not seem to
    be an application resource that handles user input or generates output. Therefore,
    this resource is not directly applicable for implementing this security check.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource does not implement proper input validation and output encoding,
      leaving it vulnerable to code injection attacks.
    partial: The resource partially implements input validation and output encoding,
      but there are gaps that need to be addressed.
    success: The resource properly implements input validation and output encoding
      for all user-supplied data.
  reason: The GithubResource is a data retrieval resource and does not handle user
    input or generate output that requires input validation and output encoding. This
    security check is primarily applicable to application resources that process user
    input and render output.
