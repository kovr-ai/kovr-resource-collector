    description: To properly implement input validation and output encoding, these
      controls need to be added to the application code that processes user input
      and generates output.
    estimated_time: Highly variable, depending on the size and complexity of your
      application.
    instructions:
    - Identify all input vectors (form fields, query parameters, headers, etc.) in
      your application where user-supplied data is accepted.
    - Implement input validation logic to sanitize and validate this data before using
      it in your application.
    - Ensure all user-supplied data is properly encoded before rendering it in output
      (HTML, JSON, etc.).
    - Use secure coding practices and libraries/frameworks that provide input validation
      and output encoding functionality.
    - Regularly test and review your input validation and output encoding implementations.

  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly applicable
    for implementing input validation and output encoding controls. This resource
    represents user account information and metadata, but does not contain details
    about application code or data processing logic where input validation and output
    encoding would be implemented.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource does not handle application input/output and cannot
      implement input validation or output encoding controls.
    partial: The UserResource partially implements input validation and output encoding
      controls, but additional measures are needed within the application code.
    success: The UserResource properly implements input validation and output encoding
      controls.
  reason: The UserResource is focused on storing and managing user account data, rather
    than handling application input/output or implementing security controls. Input
    validation and output encoding are typically implemented within application code
    or frameworks, not at the user account level.
