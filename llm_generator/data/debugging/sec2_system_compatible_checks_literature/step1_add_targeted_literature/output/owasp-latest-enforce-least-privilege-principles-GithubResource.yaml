    description: If the check fails or partially passes, it indicates that there are
      issues with access controls and permissions within the GitHub resource. This
      may include collaborators with excessive permissions, teams with broad access,
      or lack of branch protection rules.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the permissions granted to collaborators and ensure they only have the
      minimum required access based on their roles and responsibilities.
    - Analyze the permissions and access levels granted to organization members and
      teams, and restrict them to only what is necessary.
    - Implement branch protection rules, such as requiring pull request reviews, status
      checks, and restricting push access to specific users or teams.
    - Enable advanced security features like secret scanning, dependency review, and
      push protection to enhance the overall security posture of the repository.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security concept that
    restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only those permissions
    required to perform authorized tasks. This check aims to validate that systems
    and applications adhere to this principle, ensuring that users, processes, and
    services operate with the minimum necessary privileges to accomplish their intended
    functions, and no more.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub resource does not adhere to the principle of least privilege,
      with excessive or inappropriate permissions granted to users, teams, or collaborators.
    partial: The GitHub resource partially adheres to the principle of least privilege,
      but there are areas where access controls and permissions need to be reviewed
      and tightened.
    success: The GitHub resource adheres to the principle of least privilege, with
      appropriate access controls and permissions in place for users, teams, and collaborators.
  reason: The provided resource, GithubResource, contains information related to GitHub
    repositories, organizations, and collaborators. While it does not directly implement
    the principle of least privilege, it provides relevant data points that can be
    used to assess and enforce least privilege access controls within a GitHub environment.
