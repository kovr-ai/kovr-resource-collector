    description: To address this issue, your organization needs to establish and implement
      a comprehensive Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) process.
    estimated_time: 3-6 months
    instructions:
    - 1. Conduct a thorough assessment of your current software development practices
      and identify gaps or areas for improvement in terms of security.
    - 2. Develop and document an SSDLC framework that incorporates security best practices
      throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering
      to deployment and maintenance.
    - 3. Provide training and awareness programs to ensure that all development teams
      and stakeholders understand and follow the SSDLC processes and guidelines.
    - 4. Implement tools and automation to support and enforce the SSDLC practices,
      such as static code analysis, dynamic testing, and secure coding practices.
    - 5. Continuously monitor and audit the implementation of the SSDLC across all
      software development projects, and make improvements as needed.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is a service that records AWS API calls
    and related events for your account. While CloudTrail is an important security
    tool for auditing and monitoring activities in your AWS environment, it does not
    directly address the adoption of a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC).
    The SSDLC is a set of practices and guidelines for building secure software from
    the ground up, covering various phases such as requirements gathering, design,
    implementation, testing, and deployment. CloudTrail can be used to monitor and
    audit activities related to software development processes, but it does not directly
    implement or enforce an SSDLC.

  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization has not adopted or does not follow a Secure Software
      Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), which increases the risk of introducing security
      vulnerabilities during software development.
    partial: Your organization has partially adopted a Secure Software Development
      Lifecycle (SSDLC), but there are gaps or inconsistencies in its implementation
      across different projects or teams.
    success: Your organization has adopted and follows a Secure Software Development
      Lifecycle (SSDLC) to proactively address security risks and vulnerabilities
      throughout the software development process.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is focused on auditing and monitoring AWS API calls
    and events, which is a different scope from implementing a Secure Software Development
    Lifecycle (SSDLC). While CloudTrail can be used to monitor activities related
    to software development, it does not directly address the adoption and implementation
    of an SSDLC process.
