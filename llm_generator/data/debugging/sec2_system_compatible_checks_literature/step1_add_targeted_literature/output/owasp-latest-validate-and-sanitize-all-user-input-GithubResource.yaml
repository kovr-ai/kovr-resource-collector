    description: Since the GithubResource does not appear to be a user-facing application
      or service that handles user input, there are no specific fixes required for
      this resource in relation to the 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
      security check.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-validate-and-sanitize-all-user-input'
    focuses on ensuring that all user input is properly validated and sanitized to
    prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities. This is typically
    implemented in web applications, APIs, or any system that accepts user input and
    processes it. The GithubResource provided does not appear to be a user-facing
    application or service that directly handles user input. Instead, it represents
    data and metadata related to a GitHub repository, including information about
    workflows, webhooks, collaborators, issues, pull requests, and security advisories.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: User input is not being properly validated and sanitized, leaving the
      system vulnerable to injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    partial: Some user input is being validated and sanitized, but there are still
      areas where input is not being properly handled, increasing the risk of injection
      attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    success: All user input is properly validated and sanitized, mitigating the risk
      of injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
  reason: The GithubResource does not seem to be a suitable resource for implementing
    this security check as it does not directly handle user input. The resource contains
    metadata and information about a GitHub repository, but does not represent a system
    or application that processes user-provided data.
