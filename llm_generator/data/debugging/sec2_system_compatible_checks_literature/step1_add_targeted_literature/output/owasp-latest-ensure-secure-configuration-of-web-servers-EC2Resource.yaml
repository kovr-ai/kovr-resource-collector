    description: To ensure secure configuration of web servers running on EC2 instances,
      you need to review and harden the web server software and its configuration
      files.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours per web server instance, depending on the complexity
      of the configuration and the number of instances.
    instructions:
    - Identify the EC2 instances running web servers and the specific web server software
      (e.g., Apache, Nginx) installed on them.
    - Review the web server software documentation and industry best practices for
      secure configuration guidelines.
    - Analyze the web server configuration files (e.g., httpd.conf, nginx.conf) and
      ensure they follow the recommended security hardening practices.
    - Implement additional security controls as needed, such as disabling unnecessary
      modules, restricting access to sensitive directories, and enabling secure communication
      protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
    - Regularly monitor and update the web server software and configurations to address
      newly discovered vulnerabilities and security advisories.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS provides information about various components
    related to the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service, such as instances, security
    groups, network interfaces, and virtual private clouds (VPCs). However, it does
    not contain specific configurations or settings related to web servers running
    on those instances. The secure configuration of web servers depends on the software
    installed, the application code, and the web server configuration files.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more web servers running on the EC2 instances are not configured
      securely, posing potential security risks.
    partial: Some web servers running on the EC2 instances are configured securely,
      while others may have insecure configurations.
    success: The web servers running on the EC2 instances are configured securely,
      following industry best practices and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain information about the configuration of
    web servers running on EC2 instances. It provides metadata about the EC2 components
    but does not include details about the software and configuration settings required
    to assess the secure configuration of web servers.
