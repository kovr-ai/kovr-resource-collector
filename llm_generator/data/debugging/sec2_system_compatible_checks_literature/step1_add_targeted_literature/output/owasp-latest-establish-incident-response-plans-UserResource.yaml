    description: To establish an incident response plan, the organization needs to
      create a separate document or set of documents outlining the procedures, roles,
      and responsibilities for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security
      incidents.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Assemble a cross-functional team with representatives from relevant departments
      (e.g., IT, security, legal, communications).
    - Identify potential security incidents and prioritize them based on risk and
      impact.
    - Define roles and responsibilities for incident response, including an incident
      response team and a designated incident response manager.
    - Document the incident response process, including steps for detection, containment,
      eradication, recovery, and post-incident review.
    - Establish communication channels and protocols for internal and external stakeholders
      during an incident.
    - Regularly review and update the incident response plan to ensure it remains
      current and effective.
