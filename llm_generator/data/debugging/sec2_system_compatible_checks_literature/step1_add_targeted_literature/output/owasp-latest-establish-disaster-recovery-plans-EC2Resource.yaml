    description: To establish and maintain adequate disaster recovery plans, the organization
      should follow a structured approach that involves multiple steps and stakeholders.
    estimated_time: The time required to establish and maintain disaster recovery
      plans can vary significantly depending on the organization's size, complexity,
      and existing infrastructure. It is a continuous process that may take several
      months to years to fully implement and maintain.
    instructions:
    - 1. Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities
      that could disrupt critical operations.
    - 2. Prioritize critical systems, data, and operations based on their importance
      and impact on the business.
    - 3. Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan that outlines strategies,
      procedures, and resources needed for recovery.
    - 4. Implement necessary infrastructure components, such as backup systems, redundant
      data centers, and failover mechanisms.
    - 5. Test and validate the disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure its effectiveness.
    - 6. Train personnel on their roles and responsibilities in the event of a disaster.
    - 7. Review and update the disaster recovery plan periodically to account for
      changes in the organization's IT infrastructure and business requirements.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to establishing disaster
    recovery plans. EC2 instances are virtual machines that run applications and workloads,
    but they do not inherently provide disaster recovery capabilities. Disaster recovery
    plans typically involve strategies, procedures, and infrastructure components
    that enable the recovery of critical systems, data, and operations in the event
    of a disruptive event.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have adequate disaster recovery plans in place
      to ensure the protection of critical systems, data, and operations in the event
      of a disruptive event.
    partial: The organization has partially established disaster recovery plans, but
      they may not cover all critical systems, data, and operations, or may not be
      regularly tested and updated.
    success: The organization has established and maintains comprehensive disaster
      recovery plans that cover critical systems, data, and operations.
  reason: The EC2Resource represents individual EC2 instances, their configurations,
    and associated resources like security groups, network interfaces, and volumes.
    While these resources are essential components of an IT infrastructure, they do
    not directly address the establishment of disaster recovery plans, which is a
    broader organizational process involving multiple components and strategies.
