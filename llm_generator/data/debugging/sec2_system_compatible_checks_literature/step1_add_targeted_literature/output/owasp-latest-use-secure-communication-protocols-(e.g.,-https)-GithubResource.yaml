    description: This resource is not directly applicable for implementing the 'Use
      Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' check. However, if your application
      or service hosted on GitHub communicates over the web, you should ensure that
      it is configured to use HTTPS.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of your application or service.
    instructions:
    - Identify the components of your application or service that handle web traffic
      or network communication (e.g., web servers, load balancers, API gateways).
    - Configure these components to use HTTPS for all incoming and outgoing traffic.
    - Implement secure key management and certificate renewal processes for HTTPS.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    designed to ensure that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols like HTTPS to protect data in transit. This check is primarily applicable
    to resources that handle web traffic or network communication, such as web servers,
    load balancers, or API gateways.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The resource is not configured to use secure communication protocols
      (e.g., HTTPS) for web traffic and network communication, exposing data to potential
      interception and tampering.
    partial: N/A
    success: The resource is configured to use secure communication protocols (e.g.,
      HTTPS) for all web traffic and network communication.
  reason: The provided resource 'GithubResource' from the 'github' provider appears
    to be related to GitHub repositories and their associated data. It does not seem
    to handle web traffic or network communication directly. Therefore, this resource
    is not directly applicable for implementing the 'Use Secure Communication Protocols
    (e.g., HTTPS)' check.
