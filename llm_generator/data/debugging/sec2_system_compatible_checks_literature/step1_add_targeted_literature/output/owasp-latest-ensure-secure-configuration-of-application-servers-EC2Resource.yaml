    description: To ensure secure configuration of application servers, you need to
      review and harden the server settings at the operating system and application
      level.
    estimated_time: The time required can vary significantly depending on the number
      of application servers, their configurations, and the complexity of the environment.
      It could take several hours to several days or weeks for a large-scale implementation.
    instructions:
    - Identify all application servers in your environment.
    - Review and apply the latest security hardening guidelines and best practices
      for each application server type (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Tomcat, IIS).
    - Disable or remove unnecessary services, modules, and features.
    - Configure secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS, HTTPS) and cipher suites.
    - Implement access controls and authentication mechanisms.
    - Enable logging and monitoring for security events.
    - Regularly patch and update the application servers with the latest security
      updates.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS provides information about various EC2 components
    such as instances, security groups, and networking configurations. However, it
    does not directly cover the secure configuration of application servers, which
    is the focus of this security check. Application server configuration is typically
    managed at the operating system and application level, rather than through EC2
    resource metadata.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more application servers have insecure configurations, potentially
      exposing the system to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security
      incidents.
    partial: Some application servers are configured securely, but others have insecure
      configurations that need to be addressed.
    success: The application servers are configured securely, following industry best
      practices and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain information specific to application server
    configurations, which is required to assess compliance with this security check.
