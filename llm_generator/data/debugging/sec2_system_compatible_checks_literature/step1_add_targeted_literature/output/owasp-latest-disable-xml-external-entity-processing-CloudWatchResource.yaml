  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
    is focused on preventing XML External Entity (XXE) attacks by disabling external
    entity processing in applications that parse XML input. This check is primarily
    applicable to web applications, APIs, or services that handle XML data and need
    to ensure that external entities are not resolved, which could lead to sensitive
    data exposure, remote code execution, or denial of service attacks.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource does not handle XML input or processing, so the check is
      not applicable.
    partial: This resource does not handle XML input or processing, so the check is
      not applicable.
    success: This resource does not handle XML input or processing, so the check is
      not applicable.
  reason: The provided resource 'CloudWatchResource' from AWS does not appear to be
    directly related to handling XML input or processing XML data. CloudWatch is a
    monitoring and observability service that collects and analyzes metrics, logs,
    and other data from various AWS resources and applications. It does not inherently
    deal with XML parsing or external entity processing. Therefore, this security
    check is not directly applicable to the CloudWatchResource.
