  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It does not directly handle authentication protocols or mechanisms
    for user authentication. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing
    the 'owasp-latest-use-industry-standard-authentication-protocols' security check.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource does not support configuring authentication protocols
      for user authentication.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource does not directly handle authentication protocols,
      but related resources may be configured to use industry-standard authentication
      protocols.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to use industry-standard authentication
      protocols for user authentication.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is not designed to handle authentication protocols
    or user authentication mechanisms. It is a monitoring and logging service, and
    does not have any direct relevance to the given security check.
