      and updating the guidelines.
    - 3. Review the latest OWASP Top 10 and other relevant security resources during
      each review cycle.
    - 4. Update the security guidelines to address any new or emerging threats identified

  literature: The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized standard for web application
    security, and regularly reviewing and updating security guidelines based on it
    is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture. However, the provided Google
    GroupResource does not appear to be directly related to web application security
    or implementing OWASP guidelines.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization's security guidelines are not regularly reviewed and
      updated based on the latest OWASP Top 10 recommendations, leaving web applications
      potentially vulnerable to known and emerging threats.
    partial: N/A
    success: The organization's security guidelines are regularly reviewed and updated
      based on the latest OWASP Top 10 recommendations.

    or configuration related to web application security or OWASP guidelines. Therefore,
    this resource is not applicable for implementing the given security check.
