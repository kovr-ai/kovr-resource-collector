    description: To address this security check, the organization needs to establish
      a formal process for regularly reviewing and updating its security guidelines
      based on the OWASP Top 10.
    estimated_time: 1-3 months (depending on the organization's size and complexity)
    instructions:
    - 1. Assign a team or individual responsible for monitoring the OWASP Top 10 and
      other relevant security guidelines.
    - 2. Develop a schedule for periodic reviews (e.g., quarterly, annually) of the
      organization's security guidelines.
    - 3. During the review process, compare the existing guidelines against the latest
      OWASP Top 10 and other industry best practices.
    - 4. Update the security guidelines to address any gaps or new vulnerabilities
      identified in the OWASP Top 10.
    - 5. Communicate and disseminate the updated security guidelines to relevant stakeholders,
      such as developers, security teams, and operations teams.
    - 6. Implement a process for continuously monitoring and incorporating updates
      to the OWASP Top 10 and other security guidelines as they become available.

  literature: The provided resource (AWS EC2) does not directly relate to reviewing
    and updating security guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10. The EC2 resource represents
    Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud service, which provides scalable computing capacity
    in the cloud. While EC2 instances may host web applications that need to follow
    OWASP guidelines, the EC2 resource itself does not contain information about security
    guidelines or their review processes.

  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have a process in place to regularly review
      and update its security guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10.
    partial: The organization partially reviews and updates its security guidelines
      based on the OWASP Top 10, but the process is not comprehensive or consistent.
    success: The organization regularly reviews and updates its security guidelines
      based on the latest OWASP Top 10 recommendations.
  reason: The EC2 resource is focused on managing virtual machine instances, networking
    configurations, and related compute resources. It does not contain any information
    or functionality related to security guidelines, their review, or update processes.
    Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing the given security
    check.
