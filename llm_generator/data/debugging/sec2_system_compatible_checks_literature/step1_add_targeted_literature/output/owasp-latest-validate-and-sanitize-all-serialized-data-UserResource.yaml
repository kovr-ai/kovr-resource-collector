      fix is required for this security check.

  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to contain any serialized
    data or objects that need to be validated and sanitized. This resource represents
    user information and account details, which are typically stored as structured
    data fields rather than serialized objects. Therefore, the security check for
    validating and sanitizing serialized data is not directly applicable to this resource.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource contains serialized data that is not being properly
      validated and sanitized before processing.
    partial: Some serialized data in the UserResource is being validated and sanitized,
      but other instances are not.
    success: The UserResource does not contain any serialized data, so this check
      is not applicable.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any serialized data or objects that require
    validation and sanitization. It stores user account information as structured
    data fields.
