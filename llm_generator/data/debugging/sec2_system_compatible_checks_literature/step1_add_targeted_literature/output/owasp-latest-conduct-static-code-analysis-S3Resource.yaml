  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-conduct-static-code-analysis' is focused
    on conducting static code analysis on source code to identify potential vulnerabilities
    and coding errors. This check ensures that the latest version of the OWASP static
    code analysis tool is used, which includes the most up-to-date vulnerability detection
    rules and best practices. However, the provided AWS S3 resource is a storage service
    for hosting and managing data objects, and does not contain any source code or
    application logic.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The S3 bucket is not applicable for static code analysis.
    partial: The S3 bucket is not applicable for static code analysis.
    success: The S3 bucket is not applicable for static code analysis.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not contain any source
    code or application logic. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the
    'owasp-latest-conduct-static-code-analysis' security check, which is focused on
    analyzing source code for vulnerabilities and coding errors.
