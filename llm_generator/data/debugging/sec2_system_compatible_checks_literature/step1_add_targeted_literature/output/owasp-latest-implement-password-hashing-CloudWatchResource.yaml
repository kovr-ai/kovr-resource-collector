  literature: The CloudWatchResource in AWS does not directly handle password hashing
    or user authentication. It is a service for monitoring and managing various AWS
    resources and applications. The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-password-hashing'
    is focused on ensuring that applications use secure and up-to-date password hashing
    algorithms, such as bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2, to protect user credentials from
    being compromised in case of a data breach. This check is typically applicable
    to resources or services that handle user authentication and password storage,
    such as Identity and Access Management (IAM) services, databases, or web applications.
