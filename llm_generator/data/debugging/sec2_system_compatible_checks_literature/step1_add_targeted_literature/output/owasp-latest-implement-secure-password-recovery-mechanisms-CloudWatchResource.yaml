    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing secure password
      recovery mechanisms. You should review your application's authentication and
      password recovery processes separately.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the application's complexity and existing authentication
      implementation.
    instructions:
    - Ensure that your application implements secure password recovery mechanisms,
      such as sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using security
      questions.
    - Review industry best practices and security guidelines for implementing secure
      password recovery mechanisms.
    - Consider using appropriate authentication and identity management services or
      frameworks that provide built-in support for secure password recovery mechanisms.

  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, such as setting up alarms, dashboards, and log groups. It does not directly
    handle authentication or password recovery mechanisms for applications. Therefore,
    this resource is not applicable for implementing secure password recovery mechanisms
    as per the OWASP security check.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource does not support secure password recovery mechanisms.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource partially supports secure password recovery mechanisms,
      but additional configuration is required.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to support secure password recovery
      mechanisms.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is focused on monitoring and logging capabilities,
    and does not provide functionality related to authentication or password recovery
    mechanisms for applications.
