  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-tokenization-techniques'
    focuses on implementing tokenization techniques to protect sensitive data at rest
    and in transit. Tokenization replaces sensitive data elements with non-sensitive
    placeholders called tokens, which are stored in a secure token vault. This helps
    minimize the exposure of sensitive data and reduce the risk of data breaches.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Tokenization techniques are not implemented to protect sensitive data.
    partial: N/A
    success: Tokenization techniques are implemented to protect sensitive data at
      rest and in transit.
  reason: The provided resource 'GithubResource' is a GitHub repository, which primarily
    contains source code, metadata, and collaboration information. Based on the available
    field paths, there is no indication that this resource handles or stores sensitive
    data that would require tokenization techniques. Therefore, this resource is not
    applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-tokenization-techniques'
    security check.
