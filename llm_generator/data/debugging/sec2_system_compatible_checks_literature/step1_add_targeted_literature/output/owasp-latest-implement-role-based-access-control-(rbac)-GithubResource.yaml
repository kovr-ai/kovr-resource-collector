    description: To implement RBAC effectively in a GitHub repository or organization,
      you need to configure and manage roles, permissions, and access control settings
      appropriately.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance as needed
    instructions:
    - Review the existing collaborators, members, and teams within the repository
      or organization, and identify any unnecessary or excessive access privileges.
    - Define a clear set of roles and permissions based on the principle of least
      privilege, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need for
      their job functions.
    - Assign appropriate roles and permissions to collaborators, members, and teams
      based on their responsibilities and access requirements.
    - Regularly review and audit access control settings to ensure they remain up-to-date
      and aligned with organizational policies and security best practices.
    - Implement additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication and
      IP whitelisting, to further enhance access control and protect sensitive resources.

  literature: The GithubResource provided does not contain any information related
    to implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the GitHub repository
    or organization. The resource fields primarily contain metadata about the repository,
    such as branches, workflows, collaborators, and security advisories, but do not
    provide details on how access control is configured or managed.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub repository or organization has not implemented Role-Based
      Access Control (RBAC) effectively, potentially allowing unauthorized access
      to sensitive information or functionality.
    partial: The GitHub repository or organization has partially implemented Role-Based
      Access Control (RBAC), but there are gaps or inconsistencies in the access control
      configuration.
    success: The GitHub repository or organization has implemented Role-Based Access
      Control (RBAC) effectively, ensuring that users only have access to the information
      and functionality they need to perform their job duties.
  reason: While the GithubResource contains some information about collaborators,
    members, and teams, it does not provide sufficient details on how RBAC is implemented
    within the GitHub repository or organization. The resource lacks information on
    specific roles, permissions, and access control configurations.
