    description: To address insecure application server configurations, a comprehensive
      review and hardening process is required.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks, depending on the number of application servers and
      the complexity of the environment.
    instructions:
    - Identify all application servers in the environment and their current configuration
      settings.
    - Compare the configurations against industry-standard hardening guidelines and
      best practices for the specific application server software.
    - Remediate any insecure settings, such as disabling unnecessary services, restricting
      network access, enabling secure protocols, and configuring appropriate logging
      and monitoring.
    - Implement a process for regularly reviewing and updating application server
      configurations as new vulnerabilities and hardening recommendations are published.
    - Consider automating the hardening process through configuration management tools
      or immutable infrastructure practices.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS is related to Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) policies and user configurations. While secure IAM configurations are important
    for overall system security, this resource does not directly relate to the secure
    configuration of application servers, which is the focus of the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-application-servers'
    check. This check is specifically concerned with the hardening and secure configuration
    of web application servers themselves, rather than access management policies.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more application servers have insecure configurations, potentially
      exposing the system to vulnerabilities like unauthorized access, data breaches,
      and remote code execution.
    partial: Some application servers have secure configurations, but others require
      hardening and alignment with best practices.
    success: The application servers are configured securely, following industry best
      practices and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS deals with IAM policies, user access keys, and MFA
    devices. It does not contain information about the configuration settings or hardening
    of application servers, which is the primary concern of the given security check.
