    description: To address this issue, the application codebase needs to be reviewed,
      and any outdated or insecure APIs and libraries need to be updated to their
      latest, secure versions.
    estimated_time: The estimated time can vary significantly depending on the size
      and complexity of the application codebase, as well as the number of outdated
      APIs and libraries that need to be updated. For a small to medium-sized application,
      the process may take several hours to a few days. For larger, more complex applications,
      it could take weeks or even months.
    instructions:
    - 1. Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all APIs and libraries used in the application
      codebase.
    - 2. Identify any outdated or insecure versions of APIs and libraries.
    - 3. Research and obtain the latest, secure versions of the identified APIs and
      libraries.
    - 4. Update the application codebase to use the latest, secure versions of the
      APIs and libraries.
    - 5. Thoroughly test the application to ensure compatibility and functionality
      after the updates.
    - 6. Implement a process for regularly monitoring and updating APIs and libraries
      to maintain security.

  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check is focused on ensuring that applications
    use the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities
    introduced by outdated or insecure code. This check is primarily applicable to
    application code and the libraries/APIs used within the application codebase.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application codebase uses outdated or insecure versions of APIs and
      libraries, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities and potential security incidents.
    partial: Some components of the application codebase use outdated or insecure
      versions of APIs and libraries, while others are up-to-date and secure.
    success: The application codebase uses the latest, secure versions of all APIs
      and libraries, mitigating the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by outdated
      or insecure code.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and observability service that
    collects and tracks metrics, logs, and alarms for AWS resources and applications.
    It does not directly relate to the use of APIs or libraries within application
    code. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing the OWASP latest
    use secure APIs security check.
