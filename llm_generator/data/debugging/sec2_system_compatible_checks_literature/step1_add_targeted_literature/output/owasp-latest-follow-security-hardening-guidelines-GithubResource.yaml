    description: Since the provided resource is not applicable, there are no specific
      fix details. However, to pass this security check, the system should implement
      the latest OWASP security hardening guidelines, which cover various aspects
      of web application and system security, such as input validation, authentication,
      access control, cryptography, and secure coding practices.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement the OWASP security hardening guidelines
      can vary significantly depending on the size and complexity of the system, as
      well as the existing security posture. It may take several weeks or months for
      a comprehensive implementation.
    instructions:
    - Review the latest OWASP security hardening guidelines and understand the recommended
      best practices.
    - Perform a security assessment of the system to identify areas that do not comply
      with the guidelines.
    - Implement the necessary security controls and configurations to align with the
      OWASP guidelines.
    - Regularly monitor and update the system to ensure continued compliance with
      the latest guidelines.

  literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide best practices for securing
    web applications and systems. However, the provided resource 'GithubResource'
    appears to be related to GitHub repository data and does not contain information
    about the system's security hardening practices or OWASP guideline implementation.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The system does not follow the latest OWASP security hardening guidelines,
      leaving it vulnerable to potential security risks and threats.
    partial: N/A
    success: The system follows the latest OWASP security hardening guidelines, mitigating
      various security risks and protecting against known vulnerabilities and threats.
  reason: The GithubResource does not seem to contain any relevant information or
    configurations related to the implementation of OWASP security hardening guidelines.
    It primarily contains metadata, statistics, and collaboration data about a GitHub
    repository, which is not directly relevant to this security check.
