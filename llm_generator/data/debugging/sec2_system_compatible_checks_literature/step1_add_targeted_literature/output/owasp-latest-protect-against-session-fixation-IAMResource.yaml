  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS does not directly relate to protecting against
    session fixation attacks. Session fixation is a web application vulnerability
    where an attacker can force a legitimate user to use a session ID known to the
    attacker, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session. This security check
    is more relevant for web applications and services that handle user sessions and
    authentication.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM Resource is not applicable for protecting against session fixation
      attacks.
    partial: The IAM Resource is not applicable for protecting against session fixation
      attacks.
    success: The IAM Resource is configured to prevent session fixation attacks.
  reason: The IAM Resource in AWS is used for managing access to AWS services and
    resources based on policies and permissions. It does not handle user sessions
    or authentication for web applications, which is the focus of this security check.
