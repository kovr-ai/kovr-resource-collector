    description: To protect against session hijacking attacks, you need to implement
      security controls at the application level or within the specific web service
      or application load balancer (ALB) that handles user sessions.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial review and configuration, but may vary depending
      on the complexity of the application and the number of resources involved.
    instructions:
    - Review the application code and configuration to ensure secure session management
      practices, such as using secure cookies, implementing session timeouts, and
      protecting session tokens from being exposed or guessed.
    - Configure the web service or ALB to use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) and enable
      features like SSL/TLS termination and session stickiness.
    - Implement additional security measures like multi-factor authentication (MFA)
      and IP address restrictions to further secure user sessions.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS is primarily used for managing Identity and Access
    Management (IAM) policies, users, and access keys. While it is related to authentication
    and authorization, it does not directly address session management or protection
    against session hijacking attacks, which is the focus of the 'owasp-latest-protect-against-session-hijacking'
    security check.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource does not provide specific controls for protecting against
      session hijacking attacks.
    partial: The IAMResource partially addresses session hijacking protection, but
      additional measures are required.
    success: The IAMResource is configured to protect against session hijacking attacks.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS is focused on managing IAM policies, users, and access
    keys, which are related to authentication and authorization. However, it does
    not provide specific controls or configurations for protecting against session
    hijacking attacks, which require measures such as secure session management, session
    timeouts, and protection of session tokens.
