    description: To implement an SCA process, you need to analyze the application
      code and its dependencies, which is not possible with the GroupResource.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement an SCA process can vary depending
      on the size and complexity of the application, as well as the chosen SCA tool
      or service.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the application code and its dependencies that need to be analyzed.
    - 2. Choose an appropriate SCA tool or service that can scan the application code
      and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
    - 3. Configure the SCA tool or service to scan the application code and its dependencies
      regularly.
    - 4. Review the SCA reports and take appropriate actions to address any identified
      vulnerabilities or licensing issues.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to implementing a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) process. SCA is typically
    performed on application code and its dependencies to identify open source and
    third-party components, and assess potential vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
    The GroupResource represents a Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    group, which is used for managing access control and permissions for resources
    within a Google Cloud project or organization.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    partial: The GroupResource is partially applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    success: The GroupResource is applicable for implementing an SCA process.
  reason: The GroupResource is an IAM entity used for access control and does not
    contain information about the application code or its dependencies, which is required
    for implementing an SCA process.
