    description: To establish and maintain effective disaster recovery plans, the
      organization should follow industry best practices and regulatory requirements.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of the organization's cloud infrastructure
      and services.
    instructions:
    - Identify critical cloud resources, services, and data that require disaster
      recovery planning.
    - Develop detailed procedures for backing up data, replicating systems, and restoring
      operations in the event of a disaster.
    - Define roles, responsibilities, and communication channels for disaster recovery
      teams.
    - Regularly test and update disaster recovery plans to ensure their effectiveness
      and alignment with changing business needs.
    - Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect potential disruptive
      events and initiate disaster recovery procedures when necessary.

  literature: The Google Cloud GroupResource represents a group of entities, such
    as users or service accounts, within an organization. While groups are essential
    for managing access and permissions, they do not directly relate to establishing
    disaster recovery plans for cloud resources and services. Disaster recovery plans
    typically involve strategies, procedures, and configurations for backing up data,
    replicating systems, and ensuring business continuity in the event of disruptive
    incidents.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have adequate disaster recovery plans in place
      for critical cloud resources and services.
    partial: The organization has partially established disaster recovery plans, but
      they are incomplete or lack essential components.
    success: The organization has established and documented comprehensive disaster
      recovery plans for critical cloud resources and services.
  reason: The GroupResource is primarily used for identity and access management purposes,
    and does not contain information or configurations related to disaster recovery
    planning or implementation. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the
    'owasp-latest-establish-disaster-recovery-plans' security check.
