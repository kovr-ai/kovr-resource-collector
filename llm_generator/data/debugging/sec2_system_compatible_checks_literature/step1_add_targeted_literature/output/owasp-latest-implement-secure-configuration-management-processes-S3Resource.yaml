    description: 'To implement secure configuration management processes, the organization
      should establish policies, procedures, and controls for managing changes to
      systems and applications. This typically involves the following steps:'
    estimated_time: Implementing secure configuration management processes can take
      several weeks or months, depending on the size and complexity of the organization
      and its systems.
    instructions:
    - Define a change management policy that outlines the processes and controls for
      requesting, reviewing, testing, approving, and deploying changes.
    - Implement a change management system or tool to track and manage change requests,
      approvals, and deployments.
    - Establish a change advisory board or committee to review and approve changes
      based on risk assessments and impact analyses.
    - Define testing and validation processes to ensure changes are thoroughly tested
      and verified before deployment.
    - Implement version control and configuration management tools to track and manage
      system configurations and changes.
    - Establish monitoring and auditing processes to ensure compliance with change
      management processes and detect unauthorized changes.
    - Provide training and awareness programs to ensure all relevant personnel understand
      and follow the change management processes.

  literature: The provided security check focuses on secure configuration management
    processes, which typically involve organizational policies, procedures, and controls
    for managing changes to systems and applications. The AWS S3 resource represents
    an object storage service and does not directly relate to configuration management
    processes within an organization.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure configuration management
      processes for managing changes to systems and applications.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented secure configuration management
      processes, but there are gaps or areas for improvement.
    success: The organization has implemented secure configuration management processes
      for managing changes to systems and applications.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a cloud storage service and does not directly implement
    or enforce secure configuration management processes. Configuration management
    processes are typically defined and implemented at an organizational level, involving
    policies, procedures, and controls for managing changes to systems and applications
    across the organization.
