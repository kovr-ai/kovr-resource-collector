    description: To enforce password policies in Google Cloud, you should explore
      other resources and services specifically designed for authentication and identity
      management.
    estimated_time: 1 hour
    instructions:
    - Review the Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, which
      provides features for managing user accounts, authentication, and access control.
    - Investigate the Google Cloud Identity Platform, which offers authentication
      and user management capabilities, including password policies.
    - Consult the Google Cloud documentation for best practices and guidelines on
      implementing and enforcing password policies within your organization.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to enforcing password policies. This resource represents a group of users or entities
    within an organization, and its fields primarily contain information about the
    group's metadata, such as its name, description, and membership details. Password
    policies are typically configured and enforced at the organizational or system
    level, rather than being specific to individual user groups.

    partial: The GroupResource does not directly support enforcing password policies.
    success: The GroupResource is applicable for enforcing password policies.
  reason: The GroupResource does not contain any fields or properties related to password
    policies or authentication mechanisms. It is primarily used for managing user
    groups and their membership information, which is not directly relevant to the
    enforcement of password policies.
