    description: Review and update IAM policies and user permissions to ensure that
      only authorized users and applications have access to resources that handle
      user input and output data, and that they have the necessary permissions to
      implement input validation and output encoding measures.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify resources that handle user input and output data (e.g., web applications,
      APIs, databases)
    - Review IAM policies and user permissions related to these resources
    - Update policies and permissions to restrict access to authorized users and applications
      only
    - Ensure that authorized users and applications have the necessary permissions
      to implement input validation and output encoding measures
    - Test and verify the updated policies and permissions

  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS is primarily used for managing access and permissions
    for users, groups, and roles within an AWS account. While it does not directly
    implement input validation and output encoding, it plays a crucial role in securing
    access to AWS resources and services that handle user input and output data. By
    properly configuring IAM policies and user permissions, you can ensure that only
    authorized users and applications have access to resources that process user input
    and output data, and that they have the necessary permissions to implement input
    validation and output encoding measures.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM policies and user permissions are not properly configured to secure
      access to resources that handle user input and output data, or do not allow
      the implementation of input validation and output encoding measures.
    partial: N/A
    success: IAM policies and user permissions are properly configured to secure access
      to resources that handle user input and output data, and to allow the implementation
      of input validation and output encoding measures.
  reason: The IAM Resource itself does not directly handle input validation or output
    encoding. However, it is a critical component in securing access to resources
    that do handle user input and output data. By properly configuring IAM policies
    and user permissions, you can ensure that only authorized users and applications
    have access to resources that process user input and output data, and that they
    have the necessary permissions to implement input validation and output encoding
    measures.
