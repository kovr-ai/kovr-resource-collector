    is focused on ensuring that applications and systems do not expose unnecessary
    features, components, or functionality that could potentially be exploited by
    attackers. However, the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) GroupResource appears to be
    related to managing groups and memberships within the Google Workspace environment,
    which is not directly related to removing unnecessary features or components from
    applications or systems.
