    description: To implement centralized log management in AWS, you need to configure
      and use services specifically designed for log collection, storage, and analysis.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance required
    instructions:
    - 'Step 1: Set up Amazon CloudWatch Logs or a third-party log management solution
      to collect logs from various AWS services and resources.'
    - 'Step 2: Configure log forwarding from relevant AWS services (e.g., CloudTrail,
      VPC Flow Logs, ELB Access Logs) to the centralized log management solution.'
    - 'Step 3: Define log retention policies and access controls for the centralized
      log management solution.'
    - 'Step 4: Set up log monitoring, analysis, and alerting mechanisms to detect
      security incidents and anomalies.'
    - 'Step 5: Regularly review and audit the centralized log management solution
      to ensure compliance and effective security monitoring.'

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing centralized
    log management. This resource represents Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    policies, users, and access keys, which are used for managing authentication and
    authorization within an AWS account. While IAM is an important security component,
    it does not handle log collection, storage, and analysis from various sources.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource is not applicable for implementing centralized log management.
    partial: The IAMResource partially supports centralized log management implementation.
    success: The IAMResource is applicable for implementing centralized log management.
  reason: The IAMResource is focused on identity and access management, not log management
    capabilities. To implement centralized log management in AWS, you would need to
    utilize services like Amazon CloudWatch Logs, AWS CloudTrail, or third-party log
    management solutions.
