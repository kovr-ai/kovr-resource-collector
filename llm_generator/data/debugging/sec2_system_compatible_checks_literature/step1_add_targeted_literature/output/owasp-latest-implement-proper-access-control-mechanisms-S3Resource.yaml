    description: 'If any S3 buckets are found to have improper access control configurations,
      the following steps can be taken to remediate the issue:'
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - Review the public access block settings for each S3 bucket and ensure that all
      four settings (block_public_acls, block_public_policy, ignore_public_acls, restrict_public_buckets)
      are enabled to prevent public access.
    - Review and update the bucket policies to restrict access to only authorized
      IAM users, groups, or roles.
    - Review and update the Access Control Lists (ACLs) for each bucket and object
      to ensure that only authorized entities have appropriate permissions.
    - Implement IAM role-based access control by creating IAM roles with specific
      permissions and assigning them to authorized users or services.
    - Enable S3 bucket logging and monitoring to detect and investigate any unauthorized
      access attempts.
  is_valid: true
  literature: The AWS S3 service provides various access control mechanisms to ensure
    that only authorized users or entities can access and perform operations on S3
    buckets and objects. S3 supports resource-based access policies, bucket policies,
    Access Control Lists (ACLs), and integration with AWS Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) for role-based access control. These mechanisms allow you to define granular
    permissions for different actions, resources, and conditions, enabling proper
    access control implementation.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more S3 buckets do not have proper access control mechanisms implemented,
      potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.
    partial: Some S3 buckets have proper access control mechanisms implemented, while
      others may have issues or lack appropriate access control configurations.
    success: The S3 buckets have proper access control mechanisms implemented, such
      as public access block settings, bucket policies, and IAM role-based access
      control.
  reason: The S3 resource is valid for implementing proper access control mechanisms
    because it provides various access control features and configurations that can
    be used to restrict unauthorized access to S3 buckets and objects.
