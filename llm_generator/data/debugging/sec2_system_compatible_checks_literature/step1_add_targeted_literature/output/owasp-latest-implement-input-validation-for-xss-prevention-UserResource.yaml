    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing XSS prevention measures.
      To address XSS vulnerabilities, you need to focus on web applications or services
      that accept and render user input.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the web applications and
      the extent of the changes required.
    instructions:
    - Identify web applications or services in your environment that accept and render
      user input.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms in these applications
      to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Follow best practices for secure coding, such as using web application frameworks
      with built-in XSS protection or implementing context-sensitive output encoding.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' is a user management resource in
    Google Cloud, which does not directly relate to implementing input validation
    for XSS prevention in web applications. XSS vulnerabilities typically occur in
    web applications that accept and render user input without proper sanitization
    and validation. This resource contains user information and settings, but does
    not appear to be directly involved in handling user input or rendering web content.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource does not handle user input or web content rendering,
      and therefore cannot implement XSS prevention measures.
    partial: The UserResource partially implements input validation and sanitization,
      but additional measures are required to fully prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    success: The UserResource implements proper input validation and sanitization
      to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
  reason: The UserResource is a user management resource and does not directly handle
    user input or web content rendering, which is necessary for implementing XSS prevention
    measures.
