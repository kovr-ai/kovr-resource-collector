    description: To effectively monitor and alert on the status of third-party components
      using CloudWatch, you need to set up appropriate metrics, alarms, and notifications.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the third-party components running on your AWS resources and their
      associated metrics.
    - Create CloudWatch alarms to monitor those metrics and trigger notifications
      when thresholds are breached.
    - Configure alarm actions to notify the appropriate teams or trigger automated
      remediation workflows.
    - Regularly review and update the alarms and notifications to ensure they remain
      relevant and effective.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is a monitoring and observability service
    that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. While CloudWatch itself does not directly manage or update third-party
    components, it can be used to monitor and alert on the status of third-party components
    running on AWS resources, such as EC2 instances or ECS clusters.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource is not configured to monitor or alert on the
      status of third-party components, increasing the risk of outdated or unpatched
      components.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource is partially configured to monitor and alert
      on the status of third-party components, but additional configuration may be
      required.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to monitor and alert on the status
      of third-party components, ensuring timely updates and patches.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and alerting purposes,
    and does not directly manage or update third-party components. While it can be
    used to monitor the status of third-party components, it does not provide functionality
    for updating or patching those components.
