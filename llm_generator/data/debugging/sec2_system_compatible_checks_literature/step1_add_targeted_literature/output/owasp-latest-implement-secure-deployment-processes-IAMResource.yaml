    description: Remediate insecure IAM policies and user access by applying least
      privilege, enabling MFA, and removing inactive/unnecessary access keys.
    estimated_time: 2-4 hours
    instructions:
    - Review all IAM policies and remove any overly permissive statements
    - Implement least privilege policies scoped to specific deployment resources/actions
    - Enable MFA for all IAM users involved in deployments
    - Remove any inactive or unnecessary IAM user access keys
  is_valid: true
  literature: The IAM resource in AWS is relevant for implementing secure deployment
    processes. IAM policies define permissions for resources and actions, which can
    be used to enforce least privilege access and segregation of duties during deployments.
    Additionally, IAM user access keys and MFA devices relate to secure authentication
    and authorization controls for deployment personnel.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM policies and/or user access controls are not configured securely,
      increasing deployment risk.
    partial: Some IAM policies and user access controls are configured securely, but
      issues exist.
    success: IAM policies and user access controls are configured securely for deployment
      processes.
  reason: The IAM resource contains critical configuration related to access controls,
    permissions, and authentication factors that directly impact the security of deployment
    processes.
