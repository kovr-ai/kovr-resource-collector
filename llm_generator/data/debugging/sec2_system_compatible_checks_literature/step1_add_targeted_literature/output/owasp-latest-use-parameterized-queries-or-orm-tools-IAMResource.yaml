  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'

    or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools in application code. This check is primarily
    applicable to application code and databases, rather than the AWS IAM resource
    provided.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
  reason: The AWS IAM resource is used for managing user identities, access keys,
    and policies within the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. It does
    not directly relate to the implementation of parameterized queries or ORM tools
    in application code. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing
    this specific security check.
