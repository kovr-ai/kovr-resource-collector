    description: To implement this security check, you need to identify all third-party
      components (libraries, frameworks, modules) used in your application or system
      and establish a process to regularly monitor for updates and security patches.
      This process should include steps for testing and deploying the updates in a
      timely manner.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number of third-party
      components and the complexity of your application or system. It may take several
      hours or days to establish the initial process and inventory.
    instructions:
    - Create an inventory of all third-party components used in your application or
      system.
    - Subscribe to security advisories and update notifications for each third-party
      component.
    - Establish a regular schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to review and apply
      available updates and security patches.
    - Test the updated components in a non-production environment before deploying
      to production.
    - Deploy the updated components to production following your established change
      management process.
    - Document and maintain records of the updates applied to third-party components.

    which focuses on ensuring that third-party components are regularly updated and
    patched to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application or system does not regularly update and patch third-party
      components, exposing it to potential security vulnerabilities.
    partial: Some third-party components are regularly updated and patched, but others
      are not, leaving the application or system partially vulnerable.
    success: The application or system regularly updates and patches all third-party
      components to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any information related to third-party
    components or libraries used in the application or system. It is focused on user
    account information and does not provide any relevant data for implementing this
    security check.
