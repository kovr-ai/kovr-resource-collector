    description: To ensure secure configuration of web servers, you need to review
      and apply industry-standard hardening guidelines and best practices specific
      to the web server software you are using (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS).
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial configuration, ongoing maintenance required
    instructions:
    - Identify the web server software and version you are using.
    - Consult the vendor's documentation and industry-standard hardening guides for
      that specific web server software.
    - Review and apply the recommended security configurations, such as disabling
      unnecessary modules, enabling secure protocols, configuring access controls,
      and implementing security headers.
    - Regularly monitor and update the web server software and configurations to address
      newly discovered vulnerabilities and security threats.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. While it is an important security tool, it does not directly
    relate to the secure configuration of web servers. This security check focuses
    on ensuring that web servers are configured securely, following industry best
    practices and hardening guidelines to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches,
    and other security incidents.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The web server is not configured securely and may be vulnerable to unauthorized
      access, data breaches, or other security incidents.
    partial: N/A
    success: The web server is configured securely, following industry best practices
      and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-web-servers'
    security check because it does not directly manage or configure web server settings.
    This check is specifically designed to validate the secure configuration of web
    servers, which is a separate concern from logging and monitoring API activity.
