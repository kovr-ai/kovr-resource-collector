    description: To implement secure coding practices, the organization needs to establish
      and enforce secure coding standards, guidelines, and processes throughout its
      software development lifecycle.
    estimated_time: Implementing secure coding practices is an ongoing process that
      requires continuous effort and commitment. The initial setup and training may
      take several weeks or months, depending on the organization's size and complexity.
    instructions:
    - Adopt industry-standard secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP Secure Coding
      Practices, CERT Secure Coding Standards) and integrate them into the development
      process.
    - Conduct secure code reviews and static code analysis to identify and remediate
      coding vulnerabilities.
    - Implement security controls and techniques such as input validation, output
      encoding, authentication and access control, cryptographic practices, error
      handling, and more.
    - Provide secure coding training and awareness programs for developers and development
      teams.
    - Establish secure coding policies and procedures, and ensure their consistent
      application across all projects and teams.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS provides information about various EC2 components
    such as instances, security groups, and networking configurations. However, it
    does not directly relate to implementing secure coding practices within the application
    code or software development lifecycle. Secure coding practices involve techniques
    and controls applied during the coding and development phases, such as input validation,
    output encoding, authentication and access control, cryptographic practices, error
    handling, and more.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure coding practices, leaving
      its applications and software vulnerable to various security risks and coding
      flaws.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented secure coding practices, but
      there are gaps or inconsistencies in their adoption across different projects
      or teams.
    success: The organization has implemented secure coding practices throughout its
      software development lifecycle, following industry-standard guidelines and techniques
      to mitigate common coding vulnerabilities.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any information or configurations related
    to the implementation of secure coding practices within application code or the
    software development lifecycle. It primarily deals with the infrastructure and
    resource configurations of EC2 components.
