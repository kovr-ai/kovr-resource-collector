    description: To implement this security check, you would need to have information
      about the deployed web application, such as its URL, authentication credentials,
      and any specific configurations required for running DAST tools against it.
      Additionally, you would need to have access to DAST tools and the ability to
      configure and run them against the target application.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, plus additional time for testing
      and remediation
    instructions:
    - Identify the web application deployed from this repository and its accessible
      URL.
    - Obtain any necessary authentication credentials or configurations required for
      DAST testing.
    - Select and configure a DAST tool compatible with the target application.
    - Define the scope and testing scenarios for the DAST tool.
    - Run the DAST tool against the deployed application and analyze the results for
      vulnerabilities.
    - Remediate any identified vulnerabilities and retest until satisfactory results
      are achieved.

  literature: The GitHub resource provided contains information about the repository,
    its collaborators, actions workflows, security advisories, and other metadata.
    However, it does not appear to contain any information related to conducting Dynamic
    Application Security Testing (DAST) on a web application hosted or deployed from
    this repository.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub repository does not have any configuration or information
      related to conducting DAST testing on the deployed web application.
    partial: The GitHub repository contains some information related to security testing,
      but it does not specifically address DAST testing for the deployed web application.
    success: The GitHub repository is configured to conduct regular DAST testing on
      the deployed web application, and no critical vulnerabilities were found.
  reason: The GitHub resource represents a code repository and its associated metadata,
    but it does not contain any information about running or configuring DAST tools
    against a deployed web application. DAST is a technique that involves actively
    testing a running application from the outside, simulating real-world attacks,
    and analyzing the application's behavior and responses. The provided resource
    does not seem to have the necessary information or capabilities to implement this
    security check.
