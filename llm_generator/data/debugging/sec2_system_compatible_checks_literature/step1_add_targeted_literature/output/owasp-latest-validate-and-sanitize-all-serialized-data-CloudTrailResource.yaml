    description: To ensure that serialized data is properly validated and sanitized,
      you need to review and implement appropriate measures within the individual
      AWS services and applications that process this data.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number of services
      and applications involved, as well as the complexity of the validation and sanitization
      measures needed.
    instructions:
    - Identify the AWS services and applications that handle serialized data in your
      environment.
    - Review the documentation and best practices for validating and sanitizing serialized
      data for each service or application.
    - Implement the recommended validation and sanitization measures within the respective
      services or applications.
    - Regularly review and update these measures as new vulnerabilities or best practices
      emerge.

  literature: The CloudTrailResource in AWS is primarily used for logging and monitoring
    API activity across various AWS services. While it can capture serialized data
    in the form of API requests and responses, it does not directly handle the validation
    or sanitization of this data. The responsibility for validating and sanitizing
    serialized data lies with the individual AWS services and applications that process
    this data.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrailResource is not designed to validate or sanitize serialized
      data. This responsibility lies with the individual AWS services and applications
      that process the data.
    partial: The CloudTrailResource is not designed to validate or sanitize serialized
      data. This responsibility lies with the individual AWS services and applications
      that process the data.
    success: The CloudTrailResource is configured to log and monitor API activity,
      but it does not directly validate or sanitize serialized data.
