  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-deserialization-mechanisms'
    is focused on ensuring that applications use secure deserialization mechanisms
    to prevent code execution and data tampering attacks. However, the provided AWS
    S3 resource is a storage service and does not directly handle deserialization
    mechanisms or application code execution.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for this security check.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not directly handle application
    code or deserialization mechanisms. This security check is more applicable to
    application resources that handle data deserialization and code execution.
