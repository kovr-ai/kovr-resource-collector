    description: To implement tokenization techniques in AWS, you would need to consider
      other services or solutions that provide data encryption and tokenization capabilities.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the solution and the amount
      of sensitive data to be tokenized.
    instructions:
    - Evaluate AWS services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption key
      management and AWS CloudHSM for hardware security module (HSM) based encryption.
    - Consider third-party tokenization solutions or building a custom tokenization
      system within your application hosted on EC2 instances.
    - Implement tokenization at the application layer, where sensitive data is processed
      and stored, rather than relying on the EC2Resource itself.
    - Follow best practices for secure key management, data encryption, and tokenization
      techniques based on your specific requirements and compliance needs.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly provide functionality for implementing
    tokenization techniques to protect sensitive data. Tokenization is a data security
    technique that replaces sensitive data elements with non-sensitive placeholders
    called tokens, typically implemented at the application or data layer. The EC2Resource
    represents Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, which are virtual servers
    in the AWS cloud. While EC2 instances can host applications that implement tokenization,
    the EC2Resource itself does not have built-in tokenization capabilities.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2Resource does not directly support tokenization techniques.
    partial: The EC2Resource does not directly support tokenization techniques.
    success: The EC2Resource does not directly support tokenization techniques.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not have any field paths related to tokenization or
    data encryption techniques. It primarily contains information about EC2 instances,
    such as instance details, network interfaces, security groups, and other EC2-related
    resources. Tokenization is typically implemented at the application or data layer,
    which is not directly represented in the EC2Resource.
