    description: To fully implement this security check, you need to establish a comprehensive
      security testing program that includes regular penetration testing, vulnerability
      assessments, and code reviews.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the size and complexity of your organization and
      applications.
    instructions:
    - Identify and engage with qualified security testing providers or build an internal
      security testing team.
    - Define the scope, frequency, and types of security testing activities to be
      performed.
    - Develop and implement processes for remediating identified vulnerabilities and
      tracking remediation progress.
    - Integrate security testing activities into your software development lifecycle
      and infrastructure management processes.
    - Continuously monitor and review the effectiveness of your security testing program,
      and make adjustments as needed.

  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, such as creating alarms, dashboards, and log groups. While it can be
    used to set up monitoring and alerting for security-related events, it does not
    directly facilitate regular security testing activities like penetration testing,
    vulnerability assessments, or code reviews. Therefore, this resource is not directly
    applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-conduct-regular-security-testing'
    security check.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not configured to support regular security testing activities,
      such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, or code reviews.
    partial: CloudWatch is monitoring and alerting on some security-related events,
      but regular security testing activities are not being performed.
    success: CloudWatch is configured to monitor and alert on security-related events,
      and regular security testing activities are being performed.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is focused on monitoring and observability, but
    does not directly support conducting regular security testing activities as required
    by the security check.
