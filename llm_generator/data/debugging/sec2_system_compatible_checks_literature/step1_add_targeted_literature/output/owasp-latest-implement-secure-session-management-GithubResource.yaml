  literature: The GitHub resource provided contains information about the repository,
    its collaborators, actions workflows, security advisories, and other metadata.
    However, it does not contain specific details about the application's session
    management implementation or configuration. This security check focuses on validating
    secure session management practices within a web application, such as generating
    unpredictable session identifiers, protecting session data from tampering, setting
    appropriate session timeouts, and invalidating sessions after logout or inactivity.
    The GitHub resource does not provide sufficient information to assess these aspects
    of session management.

      as generating unpredictable session identifiers, protecting session data from
      tampering, setting appropriate session timeouts, and invalidating sessions after
      logout or inactivity.
  reason: The GitHub resource does not contain information related to the web application's
    session management implementation or configuration, which is the focus of this
    security check.
