    description: This security check is not applicable to the provided AWS S3 resource.
      However, if you have web applications hosted on AWS, you should implement a
      process to regularly review and update their security guidelines based on the
      OWASP Top 10.
    estimated_time: Ongoing process, with initial setup taking 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify all web applications hosted on AWS or other cloud platforms.
    - Establish a regular cadence (e.g., quarterly, annually) for reviewing and updating
      security guidelines for these applications.
    - Consult the latest OWASP Top 10 and other relevant security standards to identify
      potential vulnerabilities and best practices.
    - Update the security guidelines and implement necessary changes to the applications
      to address identified risks and align with best practices.
    - Conduct security testing and code reviews to validate the effectiveness of the
      updated guidelines.

  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-guidelines'
    is focused on regularly reviewing and updating security guidelines based on the
    OWASP Top 10 standard for web application security. This check is primarily applicable
    to web applications and their associated security practices, rather than cloud
    resources like AWS S3 buckets.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have a process in place to regularly review
      and update its web application security guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10.
    partial: The organization partially reviews and updates its web application security
      guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10, but the process is not comprehensive or
      consistent.
    success: The organization regularly reviews and updates its web application security
      guidelines based on the latest OWASP Top 10 recommendations.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service for hosting and managing data objects,
    and does not directly relate to web application security guidelines or the OWASP
    Top 10. While S3 buckets can be used to host web content, the provided resource
    fields do not contain information about the application code, security practices,
    or adherence to OWASP guidelines.
