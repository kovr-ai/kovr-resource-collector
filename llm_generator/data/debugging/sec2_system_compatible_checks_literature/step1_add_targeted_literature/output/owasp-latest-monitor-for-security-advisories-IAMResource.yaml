    description: To monitor for security advisories, you would need to implement a
      separate process or tool that tracks advisories from relevant vendors and sources,
      and then take appropriate actions based on the advisories.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify the software vendors, open-source projects, and other sources that
      are relevant to your organization's technology stack.
    - Subscribe to security advisory mailing lists or RSS feeds from these sources.
    - Implement a process or tool to centrally monitor and triage incoming security
      advisories.
    - Develop a plan for addressing advisories, including risk assessment, patching,
      configuration changes, or other mitigating actions.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly provide information about security
    advisories or monitoring for them. This resource contains details about IAM users,
    policies, and access keys, which are related to identity and access management
    within AWS. While keeping IAM policies and access keys up-to-date is important
    for security, this resource does not specifically address monitoring for security
    advisories from vendors or other sources.
