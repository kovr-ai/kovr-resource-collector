    description: To implement encryption for data at rest, you need to configure encryption
      for the specific AWS services that store your data.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify the AWS services that store your sensitive data (e.g., S3, EBS, RDS,
      DynamoDB).
    - Review the encryption options and best practices for each service.
    - Enable encryption at rest for the identified services using AWS-managed or customer-managed
      encryption keys.
    - Implement proper key management practices, including key rotation and access
      control.
    - Monitor and audit the encryption configuration regularly.

  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS does not directly handle data encryption at
    rest. It is responsible for managing access to AWS resources, including authentication
    and authorization policies. To implement encryption for data at rest, you would
    need to configure encryption for specific AWS services that store data, such as
    Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, or Amazon DynamoDB.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM policies or user access keys are not configured securely.
    partial: Some IAM policies or user access keys are not configured securely.
    success: IAM policies and user access keys are configured securely.
  reason: The IAM Resource is not directly responsible for encrypting data at rest.
    It manages access control and permissions, but does not handle the actual encryption
    of data stored in other AWS services.
