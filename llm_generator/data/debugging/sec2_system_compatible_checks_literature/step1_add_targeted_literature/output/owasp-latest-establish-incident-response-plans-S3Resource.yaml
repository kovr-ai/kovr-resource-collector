    description: To address this security check, the organization needs to develop

      impact on the organization
    - Define roles and responsibilities for incident response, including an incident
      response team and designated incident response manager
    - Establish procedures for incident detection, containment, eradication, recovery,
      and post-incident review
    - Develop communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders during
      an incident
    - Regularly test and update the incident response plans through tabletop exercises
      and simulations
    - Ensure all relevant personnel are trained on the incident response plans and
      their respective roles

  literature: The provided security check 'owasp-latest-establish-incident-response-plans'
    focuses on establishing incident response plans within an organization. This check
    aims to validate the existence and adequacy of procedures and protocols for detecting,
    responding to, and recovering from security incidents or data breaches. However,
    the AWS S3 resource provided is a storage service and does not directly relate
    to incident response planning.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have adequate incident response plans in place,
      leaving it vulnerable to ineffective handling of security incidents and potential
      data breaches.
    partial: The organization has partially established incident response plans, but
      they lack critical components or require further refinement.
    success: The organization has established comprehensive incident response plans
      that outline roles, responsibilities, and actions to be taken in the event of
      a security incident.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not contain information
    or configurations related to incident response plans. This security check is more
    applicable to organizational policies, procedures, and documentation rather than
    a specific cloud resource.
