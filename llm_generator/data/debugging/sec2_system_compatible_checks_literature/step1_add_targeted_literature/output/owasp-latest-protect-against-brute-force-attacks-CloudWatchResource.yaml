    description: To use CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting on potential brute
      force attacks, you need to configure appropriate alarms and metrics.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify relevant metrics and log sources that can indicate brute force attack
      patterns (e.g., failed login attempts, IP address patterns, etc.)
    - Create CloudWatch metric filters and alarms to monitor and alert on these patterns.
    - Configure alarm actions to notify the appropriate security teams or trigger
      automated response mechanisms.
    - Regularly review and update the monitoring and alerting configurations as needed.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It does not directly provide mechanisms for protecting against
    brute force attacks on authentication systems. While CloudWatch can be used to
    monitor and alert on potential brute force attack patterns, it does not implement
    the actual protection measures such as account lockouts, IP address blocking,
    or CAPTCHA challenges.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not configured to monitor and alert on potential brute
      force attack patterns.
    partial: CloudWatch is partially configured to monitor and alert on potential
      brute force attack patterns, but additional configuration is required.
    success: CloudWatch alarms and metrics are configured to detect and alert on potential
      brute force attack patterns.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and logging purposes,
    and does not directly implement protection mechanisms against brute force attacks.
    While it can be used to monitor and alert on potential attack patterns, it does
    not provide the actual protection measures required by this security check.
