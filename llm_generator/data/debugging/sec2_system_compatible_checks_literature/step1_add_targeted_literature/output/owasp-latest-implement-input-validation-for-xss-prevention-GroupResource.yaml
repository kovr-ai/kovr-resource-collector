  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of users,
    which is primarily used for managing access control and permissions. This resource
    does not directly relate to implementing input validation for preventing Cross-Site
    Scripting (XSS) attacks, as it does not handle user input or web application functionality.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not have any functionality related to input validation
      or XSS prevention.
    partial: The GroupResource does not have any functionality related to input validation
      or XSS prevention.
    success: The GroupResource is configured to properly validate and sanitize user
      input to prevent XSS attacks.
  reason: The GroupResource is not applicable for implementing input validation for
    XSS prevention because it is not a web application resource that handles user
    input. XSS prevention measures are typically implemented in web applications or
    services that accept and process user input.
