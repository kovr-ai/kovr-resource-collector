    description: To address this security check, your organization needs to establish
      a formal process for regularly reviewing and updating security procedures.
    estimated_time: Ongoing effort
    instructions:
    - 1. Assemble a cross-functional team of security experts, compliance officers,
      and stakeholders from relevant business units.
    - 2. Define a cadence for regular security procedure reviews (e.g., quarterly,
      bi-annually, or annually).
    - 3. Develop a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of existing security
      procedures and identifying areas for improvement.
    - 4. Stay up-to-date with industry best practices, regulatory requirements, and
      emerging threats to inform procedure updates.
    - 5. Document and communicate updated security procedures to all relevant personnel
      and stakeholders.
    - 6. Implement a process for continuous monitoring and improvement of security
      procedures.

  literature: The OWASP recommendation to regularly review and update security procedures
    is a high-level organizational practice that is not directly implementable through
    a specific cloud resource like AWS CloudWatch. CloudWatch is a monitoring and
    observability service that collects and analyzes metrics, logs, and events from
    various AWS resources and applications. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor
    security-related events and metrics, it does not directly address the process
    of reviewing and updating security procedures.

  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization does not have a defined process for regularly reviewing
      and updating security procedures, leaving you vulnerable to emerging threats
      and potential compliance violations.
    partial: N/A
    success: Your organization has established a robust process for regularly reviewing
      and updating security procedures to align with evolving threats, vulnerabilities,
      and best practices.
  reason: AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that does not directly
    relate to the process of reviewing and updating security procedures within an
    organization. This security check is focused on organizational practices and processes,
    rather than a specific technical implementation.
