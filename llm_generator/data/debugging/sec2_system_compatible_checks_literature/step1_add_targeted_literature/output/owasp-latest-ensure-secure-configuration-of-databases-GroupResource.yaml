    description: This check is not applicable to the GroupResource in Google Cloud.
      To ensure secure configuration of databases, you should review and configure
      the appropriate database services and resources within your Google Cloud environment.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the number and complexity of database services
      used.

      Google Cloud environment (e.g., Cloud SQL, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner).
    - Review the security documentation and best practices for each database service
      to understand the available configuration options and access control mechanisms.
    - Configure the database services according to industry best practices and security
      guidelines, ensuring proper authentication mechanisms, access controls, encryption
      settings, auditing, and logging are in place.
    - Regularly review and update the database configurations as needed to maintain
      a secure environment.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to database configuration or access control. This resource represents a group
    of users or entities within Google Workspace, and its fields contain information
    about the group's metadata, membership details, and source connector. While access
    control is an important aspect of managing user groups, this resource does not
    provide specific configuration settings or controls for securing databases.
