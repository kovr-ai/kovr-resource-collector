    description: To fully implement this security check, you need to ensure that CloudWatch
      is properly configured to monitor relevant AWS resources and applications, and
      that appropriate alarms, metric filters, and log groups are set up to detect
      potential security incidents. Additionally, you should define incident response
      actions to be triggered by these alarms, such as sending notifications to the
      security team, invoking automated remediation scripts, or initiating incident
      response workflows.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the critical AWS resources and applications that need to be monitored
      for security incidents.
    - 2. Set up CloudWatch alarms, metric filters, and log groups to monitor these
      resources and applications for potential security incidents.
    - 3. Define appropriate alarm actions, such as sending notifications to the security
      team or invoking AWS Lambda functions to initiate incident response workflows.
    - 4. Regularly review and update the CloudWatch configurations to ensure they
      are up-to-date and effective in detecting and responding to security incidents.
    - 5. Integrate CloudWatch with other AWS services, such as AWS Security Hub or
      Amazon GuardDuty, to enhance your overall security monitoring and incident response
      capabilities.
  is_valid: true
  literature: CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS
    that can play a crucial role in establishing incident response plans. It allows
    you to collect and analyze logs, metrics, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. This data can be used to detect and respond to security incidents,
    such as unauthorized access attempts, system failures, or performance issues.
    By setting up CloudWatch alarms and integrating them with other AWS services like
    AWS Lambda or Amazon SNS, you can automate incident response actions, such as
    triggering notifications, executing remediation scripts, or invoking incident
    response workflows.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not properly configured to detect security incidents or
      trigger incident response actions.
    partial: CloudWatch has some configurations in place for incident detection and
      response, but improvements are needed.
    success: CloudWatch alarms, log groups, and metrics are configured to detect security
      incidents and trigger appropriate incident response actions.
  reason: CloudWatch provides essential monitoring and logging capabilities that can
    be leveraged to detect security incidents and trigger appropriate response actions.
    By setting up alarms, metric filters, and log groups, you can monitor various
    aspects of your AWS resources and applications, and define automated actions to
    be taken when specific conditions are met, such as sending notifications or invoking
    incident response workflows.
