    description: To implement password strength requirements, you would need to configure
      authentication policies and password complexity rules at the organizational
      or project level, rather than on individual user resources.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - Identify the appropriate Google Cloud resource or service that manages authentication
      policies and password requirements (e.g., Cloud Identity, Google Workspace,
      etc.)
    - Review the documentation for configuring password strength requirements in the
      identified service.
    - Implement the OWASP recommendations by setting the appropriate password complexity
      rules, minimum length, and other relevant settings.

  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to contain any fields
    related to password strength requirements or authentication policies. This resource
    represents user account information such as name, email, contact details, and
    organizational data, but does not expose any password-related configurations.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource does not implement any password strength requirements.
    partial: The UserResource partially implements the OWASP password strength requirements,
      but some aspects are missing.
    success: The UserResource implements the latest OWASP password strength requirements.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any fields or properties that would allow
    for the implementation or validation of password strength requirements as per
    the OWASP recommendations. This resource is focused on storing user account metadata
    and does not manage authentication policies or password configurations.
