    description: To address this security check, you need to review and harden the
      configurations of the web applications running on the EC2 instances based on
      the OWASP guidelines.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the number and complexity of web applications.
    instructions:
    - Identify the web applications running on the EC2 instances.
    - Review the OWASP security hardening guidelines for the specific web application
      frameworks and technologies used.
    - Implement the recommended security configurations and controls within the web
      applications.
    - Regularly review and update the web application security hardening measures
      as new OWASP guidelines are released.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide best practices for securing
    web applications and systems. However, the provided AWS EC2 resource is an infrastructure
    component and does not directly relate to web application security. While following
    security best practices for EC2 instances is important, this resource alone does
    not implement the OWASP security hardening guidelines for web applications.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource does not implement the OWASP security hardening guidelines
      for web applications.
    partial: The EC2 resource partially follows the OWASP security hardening guidelines
      for web applications.
    success: The EC2 resource follows the OWASP security hardening guidelines for
      web applications.
  reason: The EC2 resource represents AWS virtual machine instances and related networking
    components. It does not contain information about web application configurations
    or security hardening measures specific to the OWASP guidelines.
