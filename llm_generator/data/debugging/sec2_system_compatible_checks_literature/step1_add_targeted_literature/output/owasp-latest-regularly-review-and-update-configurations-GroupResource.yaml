    description: While the GroupResource itself is not applicable for this security
      check, it is still important to regularly review and update access control policies,
      group memberships, and related configurations to maintain a secure posture within
      the GCP environment.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour (depending on the number of groups and complexity)
    instructions:
    - Review the membership of all groups periodically to ensure only authorized entities
      have access.
    - Update group configurations and policies to align with the latest security best
      practices and organizational requirements.
    - Implement automated processes or scheduled tasks to regularly review and update
      group configurations.

  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    is designed to ensure that system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated
    to maintain a secure posture. However, the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) GroupResource
    does not appear to be directly related to system configurations or their management.
    This resource represents a group of entities (such as users or service accounts)
    within the Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource configurations are not regularly reviewed and updated,
      potentially introducing security risks.
    partial: Some aspects of the GroupResource configurations are regularly reviewed
      and updated, but others may be outdated or insecure.
    success: The GroupResource configurations are regularly reviewed and updated to
      maintain a secure posture.
  reason: The GroupResource in GCP is primarily used for managing access control and
    permissions, rather than system configurations. It does not contain information
    or settings related to the review and update of system configurations as described
    in the security check.
