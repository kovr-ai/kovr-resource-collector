  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource does not contain or process sensitive personal data,
      so data protection regulations do not directly apply to this resource.
    partial: The UserResource does not contain or process sensitive personal data,
      so data protection regulations do not directly apply to this resource.
    success: The UserResource complies with data protection regulations for handling
      sensitive personal information.
  reason: The UserResource contains basic user account information and contact details,
    but does not directly store or process any sensitive personal data that would
    be subject to data protection regulations. This resource alone is not sufficient
    to assess compliance with data handling requirements.
