    description: Outdated or overly permissive IAM policies need to be reviewed and
      updated to align with the organization's security requirements and best practices.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial review and update, ongoing maintenance as
      needed
    instructions:
    - Identify all IAM policies and their last update dates.
    - Review each policy's permissions and access controls to ensure they are still
      necessary and aligned with security best practices.
    - Update or remove any outdated or overly permissive policies.
    - Implement a regular review and update process for IAM policies, such as quarterly
      or annually.

  literature: The IAM resource in AWS is applicable for implementing the OWASP recommendation
    to regularly review and update security procedures. IAM policies define permissions
    and access controls for AWS resources, and they should be regularly reviewed and
    updated to ensure that they align with the organization's security requirements
    and best practices. Outdated or overly permissive policies can introduce security
    risks and potential data breaches.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM policies have not been reviewed or updated in a significant amount
      of time, potentially introducing security risks and compliance violations.
    partial: Some IAM policies have been recently reviewed and updated, but others
      are outdated and need to be addressed.
    success: IAM policies are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure alignment with
      security best practices and regulatory requirements.
  reason: The IAM resource in AWS contains policies that define permissions and access
    controls for AWS resources. Regularly reviewing and updating these policies is
    crucial for maintaining an effective security posture and aligning with the latest
    security best practices and regulatory requirements.
