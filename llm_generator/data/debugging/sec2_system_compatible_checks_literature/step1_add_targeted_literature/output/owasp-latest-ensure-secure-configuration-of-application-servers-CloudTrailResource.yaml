    description: If application servers are found to have insecure configurations,
      they need to be hardened according to industry best practices and vendor-specific
      guidelines.
    estimated_time: The time required for remediation can vary depending on the number
      of application servers, their configurations, and the complexity of the environment.
      It may take several hours to several days to complete the hardening process.
    instructions:
    - Review the application server configurations and identify any deviations from
      secure baselines.
    - Disable unnecessary services, protocols, and features that are not required
      for the application's functionality.
    - Restrict access to the application server by allowing only authorized IP addresses
      or networks.
    - Enable secure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) and disable insecure protocols
      (e.g., SSL, TLS 1.0/1.1).
    - Apply the latest security patches and updates provided by the vendor.
    - Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for administrative
      access.
    - Configure logging and monitoring to detect and respond to potential security
      incidents.

  literature: The CloudTrail resource in AWS is used for logging and monitoring API
    activity across AWS services and resources. While it is an important security
    tool, it does not directly relate to the secure configuration of application servers,
    which is the focus of this security check. The check aims to validate that application
    servers themselves are hardened and configured securely according to best practices,
    such as disabling unnecessary services, restricting access, and enabling secure
    protocols.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more application servers have insecure configurations, potentially
      exposing the system to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security
      incidents.
    partial: Some application servers are configured securely, but others have insecure
      configurations that need to be addressed.
    success: The application servers are configured securely, following industry best
      practices and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is primarily used for auditing and logging purposes,
    and does not directly configure or manage the settings of application servers.
    Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing this specific security check.
