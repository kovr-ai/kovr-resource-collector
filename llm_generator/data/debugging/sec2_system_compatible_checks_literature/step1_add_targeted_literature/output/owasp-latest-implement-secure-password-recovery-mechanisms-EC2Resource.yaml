    unique_id: owasp-latest-implement-secure-password-recovery-mechanisms
  field_paths: []
  fix_details:
    automation_available: false
    description: Since this security check is not applicable to the EC2Resource, no
      specific fix is required for this resource. However, it is essential to ensure
      that the application running on the EC2 instances implements secure password
      recovery mechanisms.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the application complexity and existing implementations.
    instructions:
    - Review the application code and configurations to identify the password recovery
      mechanisms in place.
    - Implement industry-standard practices for secure password recovery, such as
      sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using security questions.
    - Regularly test and validate the password recovery mechanisms to ensure their
      effectiveness and security.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly implement secure password recovery
    mechanisms. This resource represents various components of the Elastic Compute
    Cloud (EC2) service, such as instances, security groups, and networking configurations.
    Password recovery mechanisms are typically implemented at the application level,
    not within the infrastructure resources themselves.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure password recovery mechanisms,
      leaving user accounts and sensitive data vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application implements secure password recovery mechanisms, such
      as sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using security
      questions.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any information or configurations related
    to password recovery mechanisms for user authentication. This security check is
    focused on application-level controls, which are not directly managed by EC2 resources.
