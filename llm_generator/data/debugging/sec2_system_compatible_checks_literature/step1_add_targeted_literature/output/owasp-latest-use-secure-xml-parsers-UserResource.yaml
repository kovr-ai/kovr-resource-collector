    description: Since the UserResource does not involve XML parsing, there are no
      specific fixes required for this security check.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' is focused
    on ensuring that XML parsers used in an application or system are secure and properly
    configured to mitigate risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML Injection,
    and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. However, the provided resource 'UserResource'
    appears to be related to user management and does not seem to involve any XML
    parsing functionality.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource is not using secure XML parsers or the parsers are not
      properly configured, leaving the system vulnerable to XML-based attacks.
    partial: Some components of the UserResource are using secure XML parsers, but
      others are not, leading to partial vulnerability.
    success: The UserResource is using secure XML parsers that are properly configured
      and validated.
  reason: The UserResource is a user management resource and does not contain any
    information or functionality related to XML parsing. Therefore, it is not applicable
    for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' security check.
