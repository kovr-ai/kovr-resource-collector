    description: 'If IAM policies or user access keys are found to be non-compliant
      with data protection regulations, remediation steps may include:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial review and remediation, with ongoing maintenance
      required
    instructions:
    - Review IAM policy statements and actions to identify any overly permissive access
      to sensitive data or resources.
    - Modify IAM policies to restrict access to sensitive data and resources based
      on the principle of least privilege.
    - Review user access keys and disable or rotate keys for users who no longer require
      access to sensitive data.
    - Implement additional access controls, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA)
      or conditional access policies, for accessing sensitive data.
    - Regularly review and audit IAM policies and user access keys to ensure ongoing
      compliance with data protection regulations.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS is relevant for implementing the 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations'
    security check. IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies define permissions
    for accessing AWS resources, including sensitive data. By analyzing IAM policies,
    you can identify potential areas of non-compliance with data protection regulations,
    such as overly permissive access to personal data or lack of proper access controls.
    Ensuring that IAM policies adhere to data protection regulations is crucial for
    maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive information.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM policies or user access keys are not configured in compliance with
      data protection regulations, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized
      access or mishandling.
    partial: Some IAM policies or user access keys are not configured in compliance
      with data protection regulations, while others are compliant. Further investigation
      and remediation are required.
    success: IAM policies and user access keys are configured in compliance with data
      protection regulations, ensuring proper access controls and protection of sensitive
      data.
  reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM policies and user access keys, which
    are essential for evaluating compliance with data protection regulations. By analyzing
    the policy statements, actions, and resources, you can identify potential areas
    of non-compliance, such as overly permissive access to sensitive data or lack
    of proper access controls. Additionally, reviewing user access keys can help identify
    potential security risks and ensure that access to sensitive data is properly
    managed.
