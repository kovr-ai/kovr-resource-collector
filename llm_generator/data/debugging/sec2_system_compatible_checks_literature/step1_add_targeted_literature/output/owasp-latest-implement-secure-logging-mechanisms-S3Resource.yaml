    description: For S3 buckets without logging enabled, access logging and server
      access logging should be configured to capture detailed request and response
      information.
    estimated_time: 10 minutes
    instructions:
    - 1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
    - 2. Select the bucket for which you want to enable logging.
    - 3. Click on the 'Properties' tab and then click on the 'Server access logging'
      section.
    - 4. Enable server access logging and specify a target bucket and prefix for the
      log files.
    - 5. Click on the 'Access logging' section and enable access logging.
    - 6. Specify a target bucket and prefix for the access log files.
    - 7. Save the changes to apply the logging configuration.

  literature: The AWS S3 resource can be used to implement secure logging mechanisms
    by enabling access logging and server access logging for S3 buckets. Access logs
    provide detailed records of requests made to a bucket, including the requester,
    bucket name, request time, action, response status, and error codes. Server access
    logs provide detailed records about requests that were made to a bucket and the
    response from the server. These logs can be used for security monitoring, operational
    troubleshooting, and compliance purposes.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: S3 bucket {bucket_name} does not have logging enabled, which violates
      the secure logging mechanisms requirement.
    partial: Some S3 buckets have logging enabled, while others do not. Secure logging
      mechanisms are partially implemented.
    success: S3 bucket {bucket_name} has logging enabled, ensuring secure logging
      mechanisms are implemented.
  reason: The S3 resource provides the necessary configuration options to enable access
    logging and server access logging for S3 buckets, which is a key aspect of implementing
    secure logging mechanisms.
