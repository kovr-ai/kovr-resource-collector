    description: To implement MFA in AWS, you need to configure it at the IAM or authentication
      service level.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - '1. Enable MFA for IAM users by following the AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html'
    - '2. Alternatively, consider using AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) and configure
      MFA for your workforce identities: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.html'
    - 3. Ensure that MFA is enforced for all user accounts and access to AWS resources.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    observability purposes, such as creating alarms, dashboards, and log groups. It
    does not directly provide functionality for implementing multi-factor authentication
    (MFA) for user accounts. MFA is typically implemented at the AWS Identity and
    Access Management (IAM) service level or through other authentication mechanisms
    like AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO).
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch resource is not applicable for implementing MFA.
    partial: CloudWatch resource is not applicable for implementing MFA.
    success: CloudWatch resource is not applicable for implementing MFA.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is not directly applicable for implementing MFA
    as it is a monitoring and observability service. MFA is typically implemented
    at the IAM or authentication service level in AWS.
