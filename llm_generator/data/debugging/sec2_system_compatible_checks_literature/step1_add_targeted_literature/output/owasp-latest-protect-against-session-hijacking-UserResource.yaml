    description: To implement protection against session hijacking, you would need
      to review and configure the session management settings and security controls
      within the specific web application or service that handles user authentication
      and sessions.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial assessment, additional time may be required
      for implementation and testing
    instructions:
    - Identify the web application or service responsible for user authentication
      and session management.
    - Review the session management configuration and security controls for that application
      or service.
    - Implement recommended practices such as using secure session tokens, setting
      appropriate session timeouts, protecting session tokens from exposure, and implementing
      additional security measures like IP address binding or multi-factor authentication.
    - Test and validate the effectiveness of the implemented session hijacking protection
      measures.

  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource does not have adequate protection against session hijacking
      attacks.
    partial: Some aspects of the UserResource are configured to protect against session
      hijacking attacks, but additional measures are needed.
    success: The UserResource has appropriate measures in place to protect against
      session hijacking attacks.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any fields or properties related to session
    management, session tokens, or session hijacking protection mechanisms. This resource
    is focused on storing user account details such as name, contact information,
    and organizational details, but does not provide information about how sessions
    are handled or secured.
