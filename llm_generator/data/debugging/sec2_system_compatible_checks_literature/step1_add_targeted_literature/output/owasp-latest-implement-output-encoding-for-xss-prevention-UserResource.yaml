  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
    is focused on ensuring that web applications properly encode user input to prevent
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This involves sanitizing and escaping
    user-supplied data before rendering it in web pages to prevent the execution of
    malicious scripts. However, the provided resource 'UserResource' appears to be
    a user management resource for Google Workspace, which does not directly relate
    to web application security or output encoding.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not properly encode user input, leaving it vulnerable
      to XSS attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application properly encodes all user input to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
  reason: The UserResource is a user management resource for Google Workspace and
    does not contain any information related to web application security or output
    encoding mechanisms. As such, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
    security check.
