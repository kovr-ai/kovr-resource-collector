    description: To ensure secure configuration of databases, you need to review and
      configure the database resources themselves, such as Amazon RDS instances or
      self-managed databases running on Amazon EC2 instances.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial configuration, ongoing monitoring and maintenance
    instructions:
    - Identify the database resources in your AWS environment.
    - Review the security configurations of each database resource, including authentication
      mechanisms, access controls, encryption settings, auditing, and logging.
    - Configure the database resources according to industry best practices and security
      guidelines, following the recommendations provided by the database vendor and
      AWS.
    - Set up CloudWatch alarms and log monitoring to monitor database security and
      performance metrics, and receive alerts on potential issues.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    observability purposes. It allows you to collect and analyze metrics, logs, and
    events from various AWS resources and applications. While CloudWatch itself does
    not directly handle database configurations, it can be used to monitor and alert
    on certain aspects of database performance and security.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource does not directly manage or configure database
      security settings.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource can monitor database metrics and logs, but does
      not directly ensure secure configuration of databases.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to monitor and alert on database
      security and performance metrics.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is primarily focused on monitoring and observability,
    and does not directly manage or configure database settings. While it can be used
    to monitor database metrics and logs, it does not provide the capability to ensure
    secure configuration of databases as per the security check requirements.
