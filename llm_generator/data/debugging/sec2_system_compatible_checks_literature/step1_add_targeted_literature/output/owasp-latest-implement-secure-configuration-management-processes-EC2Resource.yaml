    description: To address this issue, your organization needs to establish and document
      secure configuration management processes that cover the entire AWS environment,
      including EC2 resources and other services.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Develop a comprehensive configuration management policy that outlines the processes
      for tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes across all AWS resources.
    - Implement a centralized change management system or tool to track and manage
      configuration changes.
    - Define clear roles and responsibilities for approving and deploying changes,
      including segregation of duties and appropriate access controls.
    - Establish testing procedures to validate the impact of configuration changes
      before deployment.
    - Implement version control and backup mechanisms for configuration files and
      settings.
    - Regularly review and audit the configuration management processes to ensure
      compliance and identify areas for improvement.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to secure configuration
    management processes. This resource provides information about EC2 instances,
    security groups, VPCs, and other networking components, but does not cover the
    processes for managing configuration changes across the entire AWS environment.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization does not have adequate secure configuration management
      processes in place for tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes across
      your AWS environment.
    partial: Your organization has partially implemented secure configuration management
      processes, but there are gaps or inconsistencies in the processes for tracking,
      testing, approving, and deploying changes across your AWS environment.
    success: Your organization has implemented robust secure configuration management
      processes for tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes across your
      AWS environment.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain information about the organization's configuration
    management processes, such as change tracking, testing, approval workflows, and
    deployment procedures. While it provides details about individual EC2 resources,
    it does not cover the overarching processes required for secure configuration
    management.
