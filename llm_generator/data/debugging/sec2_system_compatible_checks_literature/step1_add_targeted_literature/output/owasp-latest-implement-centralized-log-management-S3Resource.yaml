    description: To implement centralized log management in AWS, you should consider
      using services like Amazon CloudWatch Logs, AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, or third-party
      log management solutions.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance required
    instructions:
    - Identify the sources from which you need to collect logs (e.g., EC2 instances,
      Lambda functions, load balancers, etc.)
    - Configure log forwarding from these sources to a centralized log management
      service like Amazon CloudWatch Logs or a third-party solution.
    - Set up log retention policies, access controls, and monitoring/alerting mechanisms
      for the centralized log management system.
    - Implement log analysis and visualization tools to gain insights from the collected
      log data.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-centralized-log-management'
    focuses on implementing a centralized log management system to collect, store,
    and analyze log data from various sources within an organization. This is a critical
    security practice that enables organizations to monitor and detect security incidents,
    troubleshoot issues, and comply with regulatory requirements. However, the provided
    AWS S3 resource is a storage service for storing and retrieving data, and it does
    not directly relate to log management capabilities.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS S3 resource is not applicable for implementing centralized log
      management.
    partial: The AWS S3 resource is not applicable for implementing centralized log
      management.
    success: The AWS S3 resource is not applicable for implementing centralized log
      management.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not provide functionality
    for centralized log management. While S3 buckets can be used to store log data,
    the resource itself does not implement the necessary components for collecting,
    aggregating, and analyzing logs from multiple sources in a centralized manner.
