    description: No fix is required since the AWS CloudWatch resource is not applicable
      for this security check.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' security check is focused on
    ensuring that applications and systems are configured with secure default settings
    and configurations. This check helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access,
    data breaches, and other security incidents caused by insecure configurations.
    However, the AWS CloudWatch resource provided does not directly relate to application
    or system configurations. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service
    that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and alarms for AWS resources and applications.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults'
      security check.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, and does not directly manage or configure the default settings of applications
    or systems. Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults'
    security check.
