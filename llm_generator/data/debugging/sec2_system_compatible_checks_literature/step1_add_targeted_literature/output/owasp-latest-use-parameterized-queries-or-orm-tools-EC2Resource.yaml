    description: To address this issue, the application code that interacts with databases
      needs to be modified to use parameterized queries or ORM tools.
    estimated_time: Depending on the size and complexity of the application, this
      fix could take several hours to several days.
    instructions:
    - Identify all code sections that handle user input and interact with databases.
    - Replace any instances of dynamic SQL queries with parameterized queries or use
      an ORM tool.
    - Thoroughly test the application to ensure that user input is properly sanitized
      and validated.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms for all user input fields.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    is focused on preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries
    or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools in application code. This check is primarily
    applicable to application-level resources that handle user input and interact
    with databases. The provided AWS EC2Resource does not contain any information
    related to application code or database interactions.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application code does not use parameterized queries or ORM tools,
      leaving it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    partial: Some parts of the application code use parameterized queries or ORM tools,
      but other parts may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    success: The application code uses parameterized queries or ORM tools to prevent
      SQL injection attacks.
  reason: The AWS EC2Resource represents Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, networking
    resources, and related metadata. It does not contain any information about application
    code or database interactions, which are necessary for implementing this security
    check.
