    description: To implement proper access control mechanisms in AWS, you need to
      configure and manage resources specifically designed for access control, such
      as IAM (Identity and Access Management) and resource-level policies.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance
    instructions:
    - 1. Review and configure IAM roles, policies, and permissions to control access
      to AWS resources and services.
    - 2. Implement resource-level policies (e.g., S3 bucket policies, VPC network
      ACLs, security group rules) to control access to specific resources.
    - 3. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged accounts and sensitive
      operations.
    - 4. Regularly review and audit access control configurations to ensure they align
      with the principle of least privilege.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS provides information about various EC2 components
    such as instances, security groups, network interfaces, and VPCs. While some of
    these components may be relevant for implementing access control mechanisms, the
    resource itself does not directly provide the capability to configure or manage
    access control policies or mechanisms.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2Resource does not provide the capability to implement proper access
      control mechanisms.
    partial: The EC2Resource partially supports access control mechanisms, but additional
      configuration is required.
    success: The EC2Resource has appropriate access control mechanisms implemented.
  reason: The EC2Resource provides information about EC2 components, but it does not
    directly allow for the configuration or management of access control mechanisms.
    While some fields like security groups and IAM instance profiles may be relevant
    for access control, the resource itself does not provide the necessary functionality
    to implement proper access control mechanisms as per the security check.
