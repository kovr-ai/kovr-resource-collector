  literature: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a technique used to identify
    security vulnerabilities in web applications by simulating real-world attacks
    and analyzing the application's behavior and responses. It involves interacting
    with the running application from the outside, mimicking the actions of a malicious
    user or attacker. This approach helps uncover vulnerabilities that may be missed
    by static code analysis or other testing methods.

  output_statements:
    failure: The DAST security check identified one or more security vulnerabilities
      in the web application that need to be addressed.
    partial: The DAST security check was partially successful, but some areas of the
      web application could not be tested or require further investigation.
    success: The DAST security check was successfully performed on the web application,
      and no vulnerabilities were found.
  reason: The provided resource 'GroupResource' from Google Cloud Platform does not
    appear to be a web application or service. It is a resource representing a group
    of users or entities within an organization. As DAST is specifically designed
    to test web applications for security vulnerabilities by simulating external attacks,
    this resource is not applicable for implementing this security check.
