    description: This resource is not applicable for enforcing password policies.
      To address this security check, you should review and configure password policies
      in services like AWS IAM or your organization's directory service.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes
    instructions:
    - 1. Navigate to the AWS IAM console and review the account-level password policy.
    - 2. Configure the password policy to meet your organization's requirements for
      password complexity, expiration, and reuse.
    - 3. If using a directory service, review and update the password policy settings
      according to the service's documentation.

  literature: The CloudTrail resource in AWS is primarily used for logging and monitoring
    API activity across various AWS services. While it provides valuable audit trails
    and insights into user actions, it does not directly enforce password policies
    or authentication mechanisms. Password policies are typically managed through
    services like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) or directory services like
    Microsoft Active Directory.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource is not designed to enforce password policies.
      This check is not applicable.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource is not designed to enforce password policies.
      This check is not applicable.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is not designed to enforce password policies.
      This check is not applicable.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is not directly applicable for implementing the
    'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies' security check, as it does not have the
    capability to enforce password policies or manage authentication mechanisms. This
    security check is more relevant for resources that handle user authentication
    and credential management.
