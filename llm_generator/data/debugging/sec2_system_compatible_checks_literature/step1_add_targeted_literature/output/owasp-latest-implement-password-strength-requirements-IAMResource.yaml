    description: If the IAM password policy does not meet the OWASP requirements,
      it needs to be updated to enforce stronger password complexity rules.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes
    instructions:
    - Review the current IAM password policy by analyzing the 'policies' field and
      its associated statements.
    - Update the policy to include the latest OWASP password strength recommendations,
      such as minimum length, character complexity, and regular password expiration.
    - Apply the updated policy to all IAM users and ensure that existing access keys
      are rotated to comply with the new policy.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing the OWASP password
    strength requirements security check. This resource contains information about
    IAM users and their access keys, which can be used to enforce password policies
    and complexity requirements. By analyzing the policies associated with IAM users
    and the access key metadata, you can validate if the latest OWASP password strength
    recommendations are being followed.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM password policy does not meet the latest OWASP password strength
      requirements.
    partial: Some aspects of the IAM password policy meet the latest OWASP password
      strength requirements, but additional improvements are needed.
    success: The IAM password policy meets the latest OWASP password strength requirements.
  reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM user details, access keys, and associated
    policies, which are essential for implementing and validating password strength
    requirements as per OWASP recommendations.
