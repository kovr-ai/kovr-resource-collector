    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-conduct-static-code-analysis'
      security check. To implement this check, you need to integrate static code analysis
      tools within your application code repositories or build pipelines.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Identify the application code repositories or build pipelines that need to be
      analyzed.
    - Research and select a suitable static code analysis tool that supports the programming
      languages and frameworks used in your applications.
    - Configure the selected static code analysis tool to run as part of your build
      or deployment process.
    - Review and address any issues or vulnerabilities identified by the static code
      analysis tool.
    - Establish a process to regularly run the static code analysis tool and review
      the results.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used to log and monitor activity within
    an AWS account. It does not directly relate to conducting static code analysis
    on application source code. Static code analysis is typically performed on application
    code repositories or build pipelines, not on cloud infrastructure resources like
    CloudTrail.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to log all relevant events and activities
      within the AWS account.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to log relevant events and activities
      within the AWS account.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to log all relevant events and activities within
      the AWS account.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring AWS account activity,
    but it does not provide functionality for performing static code analysis on application
    source code. Static code analysis is a software development practice that should
    be implemented within the application code repositories or build pipelines, not
    on cloud infrastructure resources like CloudTrail.
