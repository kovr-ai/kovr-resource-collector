    description: While the GitHub resource itself is not applicable for this security
      check, any web applications hosted within the repository should implement output
      encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the web application(s)
    instructions:
    - Identify any web applications or components that handle user input within the
      repository.
    - Implement proper input validation and output encoding for all user-supplied
      data before rendering it in web pages.
    - Use appropriate encoding techniques based on the context (e.g., HTML encoding,
      URL encoding, JavaScript encoding).
    - Regularly review and update the encoding mechanisms as new vulnerabilities or
      best practices emerge.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
    is focused on ensuring that web applications properly encode user input to prevent
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This involves validating and sanitizing
    user-supplied data before rendering it in web pages to prevent the execution of
    malicious scripts. The GitHub resource provided does not appear to be a web application,
    but rather a repository hosting service. While GitHub repositories may contain
    web applications, the resource itself does not directly handle user input or output
    rendering.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GitHub repository does not implement output encoding, leaving it
      vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    partial: The GitHub repository partially implements output encoding, but some
      areas remain vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    success: The GitHub repository implements proper output encoding to prevent XSS
      vulnerabilities.
  reason: The GitHub resource is a code hosting and collaboration platform, not a
    web application that handles user input and output rendering. Therefore, it is
    not directly applicable for implementing output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
