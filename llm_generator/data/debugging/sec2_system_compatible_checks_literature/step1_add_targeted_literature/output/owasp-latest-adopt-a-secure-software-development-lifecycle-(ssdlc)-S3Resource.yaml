    description: To address this check, the organization needs to implement and follow
      a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) that incorporates security considerations
      throughout the entire software development process.
    estimated_time: Implementing a comprehensive SSDLC can take several months to
      a year, depending on the organization's size and complexity.
    instructions:
    - Establish a formal SSDLC process that aligns with industry best practices, such
      as the OWASP SSDLC or Microsoft SDL.
    - Integrate security activities into each phase of the software development lifecycle,
      including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
    - Provide training and resources to development teams on secure coding practices,
      threat modeling, and security testing.
    - Implement security controls and processes for managing vulnerabilities, secure
      code reviews, and secure deployment practices.
    - Continuously monitor and improve the SSDLC process based on feedback and lessons
      learned.

  literature: The OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of
    best practices and guidelines for building secure software from the ground up.
    It covers the entire software development process, from requirements gathering
    and design to implementation, testing, and deployment. The S3Resource in AWS is
    a storage service and does not directly relate to the software development lifecycle.
    While secure storage is an important aspect of application security, the S3Resource
    itself does not provide information about the organization's adoption of an SSDLC.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not adopted or does not follow a secure software
      development lifecycle (SSDLC) as recommended by OWASP.
    partial: Not applicable for this check.
    success: The organization has adopted and follows a secure software development
      lifecycle (SSDLC) as recommended by OWASP.
  reason: The S3Resource is a storage service and does not directly relate to the
    organization's adoption of a secure software development lifecycle. The provided
    field paths are specific to the configuration and properties of S3 buckets, but
    do not provide information about the software development practices or processes
    followed by the organization.
