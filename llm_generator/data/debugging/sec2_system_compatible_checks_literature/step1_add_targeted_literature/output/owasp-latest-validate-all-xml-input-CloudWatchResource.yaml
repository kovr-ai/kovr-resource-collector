  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check is designed
    to validate XML input received by an application to prevent XML-based attacks
    such as XXE, XML injection, and other vulnerabilities. This check is primarily
    applicable to web applications, APIs, or services that accept XML data from untrusted
    sources. The AWS CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and observability service
    that does not directly handle XML input from external sources. Therefore, this
    security check is not directly applicable to the CloudWatch resource.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to the AWS CloudWatch resource.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the AWS CloudWatch resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the AWS CloudWatch resource.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and observability service that
    does not directly handle XML input from external sources. It is primarily used
    for collecting and analyzing metrics, logs, and monitoring data from other AWS
    resources and applications. As such, the 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input'
    security check, which is focused on validating XML input to prevent XML-based
    attacks, is not directly applicable to this resource.
