    description: To address this security check, your organization should develop
      and implement a comprehensive vulnerability management plan that outlines the
      processes and procedures for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities
      in a timely manner.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Establish a vulnerability management team or assign responsibilities to existing
      security personnel.
    - Define the scope of the vulnerability management program, including the types
      of assets and systems to be covered.
    - Implement processes for vulnerability discovery, such as regular vulnerability
      scanning, penetration testing, and monitoring of security advisories.
    - Develop a risk-based approach to prioritize and address identified vulnerabilities
      based on factors like severity, asset criticality, and potential impact.
    - Define remediation procedures, including patch management, configuration changes,
      and compensating controls.
    - Establish communication and reporting mechanisms to keep stakeholders informed
      about vulnerability management activities and progress.
    - Regularly review and update the vulnerability management plan to align with
      evolving threats, organizational changes, and industry best practices.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' security
    check is designed to ensure that organizations have a documented plan for addressing
    vulnerabilities in their applications and systems. This check is primarily focused
    on the organizational processes and policies related to vulnerability management,
    rather than specific cloud resources.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization does not have a documented plan for addressing vulnerabilities
      discovered in your applications and systems. This increases the risk of data
      breaches, system compromises, and other security incidents.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the AWS CloudWatch resource.
    success: Your organization has a well-defined and documented plan for addressing
      vulnerabilities discovered in your applications and systems.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is a monitoring and observability service that
    collects and tracks metrics, logs, and alarms for AWS resources and applications.
    While CloudWatch can be used to monitor for potential vulnerabilities or security
    incidents, it does not directly address the requirement of having a documented
    plan for addressing vulnerabilities. This security check is more applicable to
    an organization's overall risk management and vulnerability management processes,
    rather than a specific cloud resource.
