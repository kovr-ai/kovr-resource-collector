    description: To implement secure software supply chain practices in AWS, you should
      consider other services and controls, such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild,
      AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeArtifact, and AWS CodeDeploy, along with appropriate
      security configurations and policies.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the software supply chain
      and existing infrastructure.
    instructions:
    - Review the OWASP Software Supply Chain Security guidelines and NIST/ISO controls
      for secure software supply chain practices.
    - Implement appropriate AWS services and configurations to establish a secure
      software development lifecycle (SDLC) and continuous integration/continuous
      deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
    - Implement access controls, code signing, and integrity checks for software artifacts
      and components.
    - Implement security scanning and testing at various stages of the software supply
      chain.
    - Establish monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect and respond to potential
      supply chain threats or compromises.

  literature: The CloudWatchResource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing
    secure software supply chain practices. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability
    service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor the performance and
    health of software components, it does not provide specific controls or mechanisms
    for securing the software supply chain.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatchResource is not applicable for implementing secure software
      supply chain practices.
    partial: The CloudWatchResource is not applicable for implementing secure software
      supply chain practices.
    success: The CloudWatchResource is not applicable for implementing secure software
      supply chain practices.
  reason: The CloudWatchResource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, and does not directly address the security requirements for implementing
    secure software supply chain practices as outlined in the OWASP guidelines and
    NIST/ISO controls.
