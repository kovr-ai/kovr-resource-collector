    description: To address the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes'
      security check, the organization should focus on implementing and documenting
      secure deployment processes that cover the entire deployment lifecycle, from
      code development to production deployment.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Establish a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) process that includes
      security practices such as code reviews, static code analysis, and security
      testing.
    - Implement vulnerability scanning and remediation processes for all components
      before deployment.
    - Enforce secure configuration management practices, including version control,
      change management, and secure baseline configurations.
    - Implement access controls and segregation of duties for deployment processes,
      limiting access to authorized personnel only.
    - Regularly review and update deployment processes to address emerging security
      threats and best practices.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' security check
    focuses on ensuring that an organization has implemented secure processes for
    deploying applications and infrastructure components. This includes practices
    such as code reviews, vulnerability scanning, secure configuration management,
    and access controls throughout the deployment lifecycle. The AWS CloudWatch resource,
    however, is primarily used for monitoring and observability purposes, and does
    not directly relate to deployment processes or security controls.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure processes for deploying applications
      and infrastructure components, leaving deployments vulnerable to potential security
      risks.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented secure deployment processes,
      but there are gaps or inconsistencies in the implementation.
    success: The organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
      and infrastructure components, including code reviews, vulnerability scanning,
      secure configuration management, and access controls throughout the deployment
      lifecycle.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is not directly applicable for implementing
    the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' security check. CloudWatch
    is a monitoring and observability service, and does not provide functionality
    for managing deployment processes or enforcing security controls during deployments.
