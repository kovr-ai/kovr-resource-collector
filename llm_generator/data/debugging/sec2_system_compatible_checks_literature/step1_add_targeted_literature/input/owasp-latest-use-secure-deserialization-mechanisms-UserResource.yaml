  literature: Secure deserialization mechanisms are essential to prevent code execution
    and data tampering attacks. Deserialization is the process of converting serialized
    data into an object, which can be exploited if not properly validated. Insecure
    deserialization can lead to remote code execution, injection attacks, and data
    tampering. This check validates that applications use secure deserialization mechanisms
    to prevent such attacks.
