  literature: Session hijacking is a type of attack where an attacker takes control
    of an authenticated user's session by stealing or guessing the session token or
    session ID. This can allow the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user and
    gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform actions on their behalf.
    Protecting against session hijacking is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of web applications and preventing unauthorized access.
    This check validates that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate the risk
    of session hijacking attacks, such as using secure session management practices,
    implementing session timeouts, and protecting session tokens from being exposed
    or guessed.
