  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' check validates
    that an organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
    and infrastructure components. This includes ensuring that proper security controls
    are in place throughout the deployment lifecycle, such as code reviews, vulnerability
    scanning, secure configuration management, and access controls. Implementing secure
    deployment processes is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability of systems and data, as well as reducing the risk of successful
    cyber attacks.
