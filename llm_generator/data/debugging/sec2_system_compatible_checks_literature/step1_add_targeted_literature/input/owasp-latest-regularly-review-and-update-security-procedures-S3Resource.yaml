  literature: The OWASP recommendation to regularly review and update security procedures
    is a crucial practice for maintaining an effective and up-to-date security posture.
    Security threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices are constantly evolving,
    and organizations must adapt their security procedures accordingly. Regular reviews
    and updates ensure that security measures remain relevant and effective against
    emerging threats, and that they align with the latest industry standards and regulatory
    requirements. Failure to regularly review and update security procedures can leave
    organizations vulnerable to new attack vectors, compliance violations, and potential
    data breaches.
