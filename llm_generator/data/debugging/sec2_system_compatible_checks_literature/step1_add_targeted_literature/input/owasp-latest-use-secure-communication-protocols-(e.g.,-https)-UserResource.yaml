  literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)' is
    designed to ensure that web applications and services communicate over secure
    protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect data in transit from unauthorized access,
    interception, and tampering. HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client
    and server, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This is crucial
    for protecting sensitive information like credentials, personal data, and financial
    transactions. Failing to use secure communication protocols can expose data to
    various attacks, including packet sniffing, session hijacking, and content manipulation.
