  literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check validates that applications
    and systems are configured with secure default settings and configurations. Many
    software products and services come with default configurations that prioritize
    ease of use and functionality over security. These default settings often have
    known vulnerabilities, weak security controls, or unnecessary services enabled,
    which can expose the system to various security risks. By enforcing secure defaults,
    this check helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    other security incidents caused by insecure configurations.
