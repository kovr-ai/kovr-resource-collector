  literature: SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities
    in the way user input is handled by an application. By injecting malicious SQL
    statements into application entry points, attackers can gain unauthorized access
    to data, execute administrative operations, and potentially compromise the entire
    application. Using parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools
    is a secure coding practice that helps prevent SQL injection attacks by separating
    user input from the SQL statement. This ensures that user input is treated as
    data and not as part of the SQL command, mitigating the risk of injection attacks.
