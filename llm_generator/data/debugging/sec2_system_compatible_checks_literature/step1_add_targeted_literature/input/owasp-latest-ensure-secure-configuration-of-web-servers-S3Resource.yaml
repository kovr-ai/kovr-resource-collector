  literature: Web servers are a critical component of modern web applications and
    services, acting as the gateway between clients and the application logic. Ensuring
    secure configuration of web servers is crucial to prevent unauthorized access,
    data breaches, and other security incidents. This check validates that web servers
    are configured securely, following industry best practices and hardening guidelines.
    Insecure web server configurations can lead to various vulnerabilities, such as
    information disclosure, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.
    By enforcing secure configurations, this check helps mitigate risks associated
    with web server misconfigurations and reduces the attack surface.
