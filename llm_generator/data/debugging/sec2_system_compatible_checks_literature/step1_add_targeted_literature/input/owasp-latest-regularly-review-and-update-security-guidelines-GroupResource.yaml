  literature: The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized standard for web application
    security. It represents a broad consensus on the most critical web application
    security risks. Regularly reviewing and updating security guidelines based on
    the OWASP Top 10 is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture. As new
    vulnerabilities and attack vectors emerge, security guidelines must evolve to
    address these threats effectively. Failing to update security guidelines can leave
    applications vulnerable to known and emerging risks, potentially leading to data
    breaches, system compromises, and other security incidents.
