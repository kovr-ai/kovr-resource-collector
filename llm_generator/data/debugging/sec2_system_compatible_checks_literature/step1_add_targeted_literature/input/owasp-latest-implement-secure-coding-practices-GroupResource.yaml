  literature: Implementing secure coding practices is a crucial aspect of software
    development that helps mitigate various security risks and vulnerabilities. This
    check validates whether an organization has adopted and enforced secure coding
    practices throughout its software development lifecycle. Secure coding practices
    involve following industry-standard guidelines, using secure coding techniques,
    and implementing security controls to prevent common coding vulnerabilities such
    as injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and more.
    By adhering to secure coding practices, organizations can reduce the attack surface,
    enhance the overall security posture of their applications, and protect sensitive
    data from potential breaches.
