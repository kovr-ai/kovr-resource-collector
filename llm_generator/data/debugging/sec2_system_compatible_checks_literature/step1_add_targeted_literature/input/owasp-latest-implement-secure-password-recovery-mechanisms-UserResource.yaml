  literature: Secure password recovery mechanisms are essential for protecting user
    accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access. This check validates that
    the application implements robust and secure password recovery processes, such
    as sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using security
    questions. Insecure password recovery mechanisms can lead to account takeovers,
    data breaches, and other security incidents. Implementing secure password recovery
    mechanisms helps ensure that only authorized users can regain access to their
    accounts, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure.
