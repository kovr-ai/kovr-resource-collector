  literature: Session fixation is a type of attack that occurs when an attacker is
    able to force a legitimate user to use a session ID known to the attacker. This
    can allow the attacker to hijack the user's session and gain unauthorized access
    to the user's data or perform actions on their behalf. Protecting against session
    fixation is important to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the integrity
    and confidentiality of user sessions and data.
