  literature: Secure key management is a critical aspect of ensuring the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Keys are used to encrypt and decrypt
    data, authenticate users and systems, and ensure the integrity of data transmissions.
    Improper key management can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other
    security incidents. This check validates that an application or system implements
    secure key management practices, such as using strong encryption algorithms, properly
    generating and storing keys, regularly rotating keys, and securely distributing
    keys to authorized parties. Failure to implement secure key management can result
    in data exposure, unauthorized access, and other security risks.
