  literature: The OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of
    best practices and guidelines for building secure software from the ground up.
    It emphasizes the importance of incorporating security considerations throughout
    the entire software development process, from requirements gathering and design
    to implementation, testing, and deployment. By adopting an SSDLC, organizations
    can proactively address security risks and vulnerabilities, rather than reactively
    addressing them after the software is released. This check validates whether an
    organization has adopted and follows a secure SSDLC, which is crucial for developing
    secure and resilient applications that can withstand various cyber threats.
