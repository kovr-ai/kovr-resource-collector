  literature: Password policies are a set of rules and requirements that govern the
    creation, usage, and management of passwords within an organization or system.
    These policies aim to enhance the security of authentication mechanisms by enforcing
    strong password practices, reducing the risk of password guessing or cracking
    attacks, and mitigating the potential impact of compromised credentials. Implementing
    robust password policies is crucial for protecting sensitive information, maintaining
    system integrity, and preventing unauthorized access. This security check validates
    the existence and enforcement of strong password policies, which typically include
    requirements such as minimum password length, complexity rules, password expiration
    periods, and restrictions on password reuse.
