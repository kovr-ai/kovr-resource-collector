  literature: The OWASP latest use secure APIs check validates that applications use
    the latest, secure versions of APIs and libraries to prevent vulnerabilities introduced
    by outdated or insecure code. Using outdated or insecure APIs can expose applications
    to known vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access,
    and other security incidents. This check is important because it helps ensure
    that applications are built with secure and up-to-date components, reducing the
    attack surface and minimizing the risk of exploitation.
