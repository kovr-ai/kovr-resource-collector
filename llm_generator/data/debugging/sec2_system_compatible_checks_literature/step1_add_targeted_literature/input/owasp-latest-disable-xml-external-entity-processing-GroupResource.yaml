  literature: The XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a type of vulnerability that
    can occur when an application parses XML input in an insecure manner, allowing
    an attacker to interfere with the application's processing of XML data. By exploiting
    XXE vulnerabilities, an attacker can potentially read sensitive data, execute
    remote requests, or cause a denial of service condition. Disabling external entity
    processing is a critical security measure to prevent XXE attacks, as it prevents
    the application from resolving external references and entities, effectively mitigating
    the risk of XXE exploitation.
