  - ISO-27001-A.9.4.1
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. Access controls are essential security mechanisms that ensure
    only authorized users or entities can access and perform specific actions on protected
    resources or data. Failing to implement proper access controls on the server-side
    can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security vulnerabilities.
    This check helps identify and mitigate risks associated with improper access control
    implementation, such as broken authentication, broken access control, and insecure
    direct object references.
