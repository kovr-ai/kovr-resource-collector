  literature: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires
    users to provide two or more forms of authentication to verify their identity
    before granting access to a system, application, or resource. This check validates
    that MFA is implemented and enforced for all user accounts, ensuring an additional
    layer of security beyond just a password. MFA significantly reduces the risk of
    unauthorized access, even if one factor (e.g., a password) is compromised. It
    is an essential security control to protect against various attack vectors, such
    as brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and phishing attempts.
