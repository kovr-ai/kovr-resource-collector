  literature: Input validation and output encoding are critical security measures
    to prevent various types of code injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting
    (XSS), SQL Injection, and Command Injection. Input validation ensures that user-supplied
    data is properly sanitized and validated before being processed by the application,
    while output encoding ensures that any user-supplied data is properly encoded
    before being rendered in the application's output (e.g., web pages, API responses).
    Failure to implement these measures can lead to severe security vulnerabilities
    that allow attackers to execute malicious code, access or modify sensitive data,
    or perform other unauthorized actions.
