  literature: Centralized log management is a critical security practice that involves
    collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from various sources (e.g., servers,
    applications, network devices) in a centralized location. This enables organizations
    to monitor and detect security incidents, troubleshoot issues, and comply with
    regulatory requirements. Without centralized log management, it becomes challenging
    to gain visibility into system activities, identify potential threats, and respond
    to incidents effectively. Implementing centralized log management enhances an
    organization's security posture by providing a comprehensive view of system events,
    enabling timely detection of anomalies, and facilitating incident response and
    forensic investigations.
