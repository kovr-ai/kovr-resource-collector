  literature: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web application vulnerability
    that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page. This code is
    executed by the victim's web browser, potentially allowing the attacker to hijack
    user sessions, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites. Implementing
    input validation for XSS prevention is a crucial security measure that helps protect
    web applications from XSS attacks. Input validation involves sanitizing and validating
    user input to ensure that it does not contain any malicious code or scripts. By
    properly validating and sanitizing user input, web applications can prevent XSS
    attacks and protect sensitive data from being compromised.
