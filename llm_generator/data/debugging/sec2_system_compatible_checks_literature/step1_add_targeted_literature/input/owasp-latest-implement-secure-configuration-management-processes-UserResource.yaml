  literature: Secure configuration management processes are essential for maintaining
    the integrity and security of systems and applications. This check validates that
    organizations have implemented robust processes for managing configuration changes,
    including tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes in a controlled
    manner. Failure to implement secure configuration management processes can lead
    to unauthorized or unintended changes, which can introduce vulnerabilities, system
    instability, and compliance issues. Secure configuration management processes
    help ensure that changes are properly reviewed, tested, and approved before deployment,
    reducing the risk of security incidents and system outages.
