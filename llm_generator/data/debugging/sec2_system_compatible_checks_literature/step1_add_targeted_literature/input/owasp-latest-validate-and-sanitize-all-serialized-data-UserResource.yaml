  literature: Serialized data, such as objects or data structures, can contain sensitive
    information or executable code. If this data is not properly validated and sanitized,
    it can lead to various security vulnerabilities like code injection, data tampering,
    or unauthorized access. This check ensures that all serialized data is thoroughly
    validated and sanitized before being processed or deserialized, mitigating the
    risk of attacks that exploit insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
