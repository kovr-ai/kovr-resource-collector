  literature: Data in transit refers to any data that is being transmitted across
    a network or communication channel. Implementing encryption for data in transit
    is a crucial security measure to protect sensitive information from being intercepted
    or eavesdropped by unauthorized parties. Without proper encryption, data transmitted
    over networks can be easily captured and read by attackers, leading to data breaches
    and compromised confidentiality. Encrypting data in transit ensures that even
    if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable and secure, preventing unauthorized
    access and maintaining data integrity. This check validates that appropriate encryption
    mechanisms are in place for all data transmissions, ensuring the confidentiality
    and integrity of sensitive information during transit.
