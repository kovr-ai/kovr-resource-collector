  literature: Static code analysis is the process of analyzing source code without
    executing it, to detect potential vulnerabilities, coding errors, and deviations
    from best practices. It is an essential practice in software development to identify
    and mitigate security risks early in the software development life cycle (SDLC).
    By conducting static code analysis, developers can identify and remediate issues
    such as insecure coding practices, use of deprecated or vulnerable libraries,
    and potential entry points for attacks. This check ensures that the latest version
    of the OWASP static code analysis tool is used, which includes the most up-to-date
    vulnerability detection rules and best practices.
