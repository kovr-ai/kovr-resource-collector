  literature: Comprehensive logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining visibility
    into system activities, detecting potential security incidents, and enabling effective
    incident response and forensic analysis. Logging captures detailed information
    about user actions, system events, and security-related activities, providing
    a trail of evidence that can be used to investigate and respond to security breaches,
    policy violations, or operational issues. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
    helps organizations meet compliance requirements, identify and mitigate risks,
    and maintain accountability. Without proper logging, it becomes challenging to
    detect and respond to security incidents, leaving systems vulnerable to various
    threats.
