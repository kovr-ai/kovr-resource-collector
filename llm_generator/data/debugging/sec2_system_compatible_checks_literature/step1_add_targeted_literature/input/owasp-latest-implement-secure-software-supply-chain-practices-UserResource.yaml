  literature: Secure software supply chain practices are essential for ensuring the
    integrity and security of software throughout its entire lifecycle, from development
    to deployment. This check validates that organizations have implemented robust
    processes and controls to protect their software supply chain from potential threats
    and vulnerabilities. A compromised software supply chain can lead to the introduction
    of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities, which can have severe consequences
    for the organization's systems and data. By implementing secure software supply
    chain practices, organizations can mitigate risks such as software tampering,
    unauthorized access, and supply chain attacks.
