  literature: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a process that identifies and
    analyzes the open source and third-party components used in an application. It
    helps organizations understand the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated
    with these components, enabling them to make informed decisions about their use
    and take appropriate mitigation measures. Implementing an SCA process is crucial
    because it helps organizations maintain the security, compliance, and quality
    of their software by identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities, license
    compliance issues, and outdated or unsupported components. By regularly scanning
    their applications for known vulnerabilities and licensing issues, organizations
    can proactively address these risks and reduce the likelihood of security breaches,
    legal issues, and other problems.
