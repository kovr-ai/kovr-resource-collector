  literature: The 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations' check is designed
    to ensure that organizations comply with relevant data protection regulations
    and industry standards when handling sensitive information. Data protection regulations,
    such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer
    Privacy Act (CCPA), impose strict requirements on how organizations collect, process,
    store, and transfer personal data. Failure to comply with these regulations can
    result in significant fines and reputational damage. This check helps organizations
    identify potential areas of non-compliance and take appropriate measures to protect
    sensitive data and maintain regulatory compliance.
