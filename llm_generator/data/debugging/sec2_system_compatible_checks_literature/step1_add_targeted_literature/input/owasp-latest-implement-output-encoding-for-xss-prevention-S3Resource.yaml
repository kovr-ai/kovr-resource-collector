  literature: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web application vulnerability
    that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page. This code is
    then executed by the victim's web browser, potentially allowing the attacker to
    steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions.
    Implementing output encoding for XSS prevention is a crucial security measure
    that helps mitigate this vulnerability. Output encoding involves properly escaping
    or sanitizing user input before rendering it in the web page, ensuring that any
    potentially malicious code is treated as plain text and not executed by the browser.
    This check validates that the application properly encodes all output to prevent
    XSS attacks, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of
    the web application.
