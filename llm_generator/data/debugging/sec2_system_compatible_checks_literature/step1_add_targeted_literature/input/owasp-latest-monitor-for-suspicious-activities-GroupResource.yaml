  literature: The 'owasp-latest-monitor-for-suspicious-activities' check is designed
    to detect and alert on any suspicious or anomalous activities within an organization's
    systems and applications. It continuously monitors user behavior, system logs,
    network traffic, and other relevant data sources to identify potential security
    threats or unauthorized actions. This check is crucial because it helps organizations
    proactively identify and respond to potential security incidents, such as unauthorized
    access attempts, data exfiltration, or malicious insider activities. By monitoring
    for suspicious activities, organizations can take timely action to mitigate risks,
    investigate incidents, and prevent further damage or data breaches.
