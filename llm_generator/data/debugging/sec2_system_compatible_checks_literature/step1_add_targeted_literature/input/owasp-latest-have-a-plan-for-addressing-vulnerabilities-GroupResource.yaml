  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' check
    is designed to ensure that organizations have a well-defined and documented plan
    for addressing vulnerabilities discovered in their applications and systems. Vulnerabilities
    can pose significant risks to an organization's security posture, potentially
    leading to data breaches, system compromises, and other security incidents. Having
    a plan in place for addressing vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining the
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization's information
    assets. This check validates that such a plan exists and is regularly reviewed
    and updated to reflect the evolving threat landscape and organizational needs.
