  literature: Security advisories are notifications issued by software vendors, security
    researchers, or other organizations to inform users about vulnerabilities, security
    flaws, or other security-related issues in their products or services. Monitoring
    for security advisories is crucial because it allows organizations to stay informed
    about potential threats and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks. Failing
    to monitor for security advisories can leave systems and applications vulnerable
    to known attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromises, or
    other security incidents.
