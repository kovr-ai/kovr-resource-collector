  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' check is designed to validate
    all XML input received by an application to prevent various types of XML-based
    attacks. XML is a widely used data format for exchanging structured information,
    and it is crucial to validate and sanitize XML input to mitigate risks such as
    XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML injection, and other XML-related vulnerabilities.
    Failing to properly validate XML input can lead to data leaks, unauthorized access,
    denial of service, and remote code execution, depending on the context and the
    application's functionality.
