  literature: Secure session management is a critical aspect of web application security.
    It involves protecting user sessions from unauthorized access, hijacking, and
    other attacks. This check validates that the application implements secure session
    management practices, such as generating unpredictable session identifiers, protecting
    session data from tampering, setting appropriate session timeouts, and invalidating
    sessions after logout or inactivity. Failure to implement secure session management
    can lead to session hijacking, unauthorized access, and other security vulnerabilities.
