  literature: The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security concept that
    restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only those permissions
    required to perform authorized tasks. By enforcing least privilege, organizations
    can reduce their attack surface, limit potential damage from malicious actors,
    and mitigate the risks associated with excessive permissions. This check validates
    that systems and applications adhere to the least privilege principle, ensuring
    that users, processes, and services operate with the minimum necessary privileges
    to accomplish their intended functions, and no more. Implementing least privilege
    is crucial for maintaining a robust security posture and protecting sensitive
    data and systems from unauthorized access or misuse.
