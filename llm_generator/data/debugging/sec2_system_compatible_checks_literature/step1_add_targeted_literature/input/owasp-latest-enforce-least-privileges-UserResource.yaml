  literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check validates that applications
    and systems follow the principle of least privilege, which is a fundamental security
    concept that restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only
    those permissions that are essential for performing their intended functions.
    Granting excessive privileges increases the potential attack surface and risk
    of unauthorized access or misuse. This check helps mitigate threats like privilege
    escalation, unauthorized data access, and malicious code execution by ensuring
    that entities operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
