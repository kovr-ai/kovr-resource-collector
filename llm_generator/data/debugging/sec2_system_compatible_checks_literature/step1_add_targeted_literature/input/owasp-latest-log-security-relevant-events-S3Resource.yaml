  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. Logging security-relevant events helps detect and investigate
    potential security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and other malicious
    activities. It provides a record of system activities, user actions, and security-related
    incidents, enabling organizations to monitor and analyze system behavior, identify
    potential threats, and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.
