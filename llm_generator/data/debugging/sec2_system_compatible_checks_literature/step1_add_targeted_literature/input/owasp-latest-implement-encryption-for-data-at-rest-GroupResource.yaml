  literature: Data at rest refers to inactive data stored on any digital medium, such
    as hard drives, databases, cloud storage, or backup tapes. Implementing encryption
    for data at rest is a crucial security measure to protect sensitive information
    from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats. Unencrypted data at
    rest is vulnerable to theft, misuse, or exposure, which can lead to severe consequences
    like identity theft, financial loss, and regulatory non-compliance. Encrypting
    data at rest ensures that even if an attacker gains physical access to the storage
    medium, the data remains unintelligible and unusable without the proper decryption
    keys. This check validates that encryption is implemented for all data at rest,
    following industry-standard encryption algorithms and key management practices.
