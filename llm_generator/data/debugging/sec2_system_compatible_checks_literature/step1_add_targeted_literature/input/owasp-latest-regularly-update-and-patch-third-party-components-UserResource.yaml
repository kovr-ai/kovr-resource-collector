  literature: Third-party components, such as libraries, frameworks, and modules,
    are widely used in software development to leverage existing functionality and
    accelerate the development process. However, these components can introduce security
    vulnerabilities if they are not regularly updated and patched. Outdated or unpatched
    third-party components can expose applications to known vulnerabilities, which
    can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code,
    or compromise sensitive data. Regularly updating and patching third-party components
    is a critical security practice that helps mitigate the risk of vulnerabilities
    and ensures that applications remain secure.
