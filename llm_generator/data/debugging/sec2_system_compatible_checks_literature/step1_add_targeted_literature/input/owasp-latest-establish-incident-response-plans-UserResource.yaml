  literature: Establishing incident response plans is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity
    preparedness. It involves creating a comprehensive set of procedures and protocols
    to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents or data
    breaches. An incident response plan outlines the roles, responsibilities, and
    actions to be taken by the organization in the event of a security incident, ensuring
    a coordinated and efficient response. This check validates the existence and adequacy
    of such plans, which are essential for minimizing the impact of security incidents,
    protecting sensitive data, maintaining business continuity, and complying with
    regulatory requirements. By having well-defined incident response plans in place,
    organizations can respond swiftly and effectively to security incidents, mitigate
    potential damages, and enhance their overall cybersecurity posture.
