  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    is designed to ensure that system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated
    to maintain a secure posture. As systems evolve and new vulnerabilities are discovered,
    it is crucial to keep configurations up-to-date to mitigate potential risks. Outdated
    configurations can introduce security vulnerabilities, expose sensitive data,
    or enable unauthorized access. Regular reviews and updates help identify and address
    misconfigurations, apply security patches, and align with the latest security
    best practices.
