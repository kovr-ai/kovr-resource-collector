  literature: Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, is
    a simulated cyber attack against an organization's computer systems, networks,
    and web applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be
    exploited by malicious actors. It is an essential practice in cybersecurity to
    proactively identify and mitigate potential security risks before they can be
    exploited by real-world attackers. Conducting regular penetration testing helps
    organizations assess the effectiveness of their security controls, identify gaps
    in their defenses, and prioritize remediation efforts. By simulating real-world
    attack scenarios, penetration testing provides valuable insights into an organization's
    security posture and helps strengthen its overall cybersecurity resilience.
