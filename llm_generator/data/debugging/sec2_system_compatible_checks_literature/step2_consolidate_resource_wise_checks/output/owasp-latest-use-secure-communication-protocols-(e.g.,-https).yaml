    literature: The OWASP check 'Use Secure Communication Protocols (e.g., HTTPS)'
      is primarily focused on ensuring that web applications and services communicate
      over secure protocols like HTTPS. However, for AWS S3 buckets, the relevant
      security aspect is ensuring that data at rest is encrypted and that public access
      is restricted. While S3 buckets do not directly handle communication protocols,
      implementing encryption and access controls aligns with the broader principle
      of protecting data from unauthorized access and tampering.

    reason: While S3 buckets do not directly handle communication protocols, ensuring
      that data at rest is encrypted and public access is restricted aligns with the
      broader principle of protecting data from unauthorized access and tampering,
      which is the intent of the OWASP check.
