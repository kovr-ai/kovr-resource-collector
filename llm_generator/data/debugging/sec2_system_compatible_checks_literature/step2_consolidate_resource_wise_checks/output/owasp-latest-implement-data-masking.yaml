    literature: The AWS S3 service provides data encryption capabilities that can
      be used to implement data masking and protect sensitive information stored in
      S3 buckets. By enabling server-side encryption (SSE) with either AWS-managed
      keys (SSE-S3) or customer-managed keys (SSE-KMS), S3 automatically encrypts
      data at rest, effectively masking the original data. Additionally, S3 bucket
      policies and access controls can be configured to restrict access to authorized
      users/roles, further enhancing data protection.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3Resource provides encryption and access control capabilities that
      can be used to implement data masking and protect sensitive data stored in S3
      buckets.
