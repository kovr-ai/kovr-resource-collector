    literature: The GitHub resource contains information related to the security practices
      and controls implemented for the software supply chain of the repository. This
      includes details about the workflows and actions used for continuous integration
      and deployment, as well as security features like code scanning, dependency
      analysis, and vulnerability alerts. By analyzing this data, organizations can
      assess their adherence to secure software supply chain practices and identify
      potential gaps or areas for improvement.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events, providing a comprehensive audit trail of activities across your AWS
      account. By configuring CloudTrail to log relevant events and storing the logs
      in a secure and immutable location, organizations can implement secure software
      supply chain practices by monitoring and auditing activities related to their
      software deployments and infrastructure changes. This allows for the detection
      of unauthorized or malicious actions, enabling organizations to respond promptly
      and mitigate potential threats to their software supply chain.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: AWS CloudTrail provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
      that can be leveraged to implement secure software supply chain practices. By
      configuring CloudTrail to log relevant events, organizations can audit and monitor
      activities related to their software deployments, infrastructure changes, and
      other critical operations, enabling them to detect and respond to potential
      threats or unauthorized actions.
