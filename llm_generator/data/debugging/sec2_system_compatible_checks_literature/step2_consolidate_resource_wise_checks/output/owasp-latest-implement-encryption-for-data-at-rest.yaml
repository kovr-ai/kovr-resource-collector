    literature: The AWS S3 resource is applicable for implementing encryption for
      data at rest. S3 buckets can be configured to use server-side encryption to
      protect data stored in the bucket. AWS provides several encryption options,
      including AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3), AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) managed
      keys, and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Enabling encryption for S3 buckets
      ensures that data is encrypted before it is written to disks, and decrypted
      after it is accessed, providing protection for data at rest.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3 resource provides fields to configure and manage encryption for
      data stored in S3 buckets, which aligns with the security check's requirement
      of implementing encryption for data at rest.
