    literature: The IAM (Identity and Access Management) resource in AWS is relevant
      for implementing the security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-policies'.
      IAM policies define permissions and access controls for AWS resources, making
      them a crucial component of an organization's overall security posture. Regular
      review and updates of these policies are essential to ensure that access privileges
      align with the principle of least privilege and reflect changes in organizational
      requirements, personnel, and security best practices.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource contains information about IAM policies, their creation
      and update dates, and the policy document details, including the actions, resources,
      and effects defined in the policy statements. These fields are crucial for reviewing
      and updating security policies to ensure they align with the organization's
      security requirements and best practices.
