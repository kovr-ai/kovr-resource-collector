    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is directly applicable for implementing
      the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' security check. CloudTrail is
      a service that records AWS API calls and related events, providing a comprehensive
      audit trail of activities across your AWS account. By configuring CloudTrail
      to log security-relevant events, you can meet the requirements of this check
      and maintain a detailed record of security-related activities for incident response,
      forensic analysis, and compliance purposes.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource allows you to configure event selectors and data
      resources to capture specific security-relevant events, including management
      events and read/write operations. Additionally, you can enable log file validation
      to ensure the integrity of the logs. These features directly align with the
      requirements of the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check, making
      CloudTrail a valid resource for implementing this security control.

    literature: The CloudWatch service in AWS can be used to implement the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events'
      security check. CloudWatch allows you to collect and monitor logs from various
      AWS resources and services, including security-related events. By configuring
      CloudWatch Log Groups and Metric Filters, you can capture and analyze log data
      to detect and investigate potential security incidents, unauthorized access
      attempts, and other security-relevant events.
    name: CloudWatchResource
    reason: The CloudWatch resource in AWS provides logging and monitoring capabilities
      that can be used to capture and analyze security-relevant events, which aligns
      with the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' security check.
