    literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement protection against
      brute force attacks on IAM user accounts. By configuring appropriate password
      policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, and access key rotation
      policies, you can significantly reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks
      on IAM user credentials.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM user accounts, access keys, and
      password/MFA policies, which are essential for implementing brute force attack
      protection mechanisms.
