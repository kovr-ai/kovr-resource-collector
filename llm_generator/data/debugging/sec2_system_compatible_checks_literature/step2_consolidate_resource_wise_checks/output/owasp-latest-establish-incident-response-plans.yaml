    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events, providing a comprehensive audit trail of activities across your AWS
      account. By configuring CloudTrail appropriately, you can capture and analyze
      logs to detect and respond to security incidents effectively. This resource
      is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-establish-incident-response-plans'
      security check as it allows you to set up logging and monitoring mechanisms,
      which are crucial components of an incident response plan.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource allows you to configure and manage trails, which
      capture API activity logs across your AWS account. By enabling appropriate event
      selectors, data resource types, and management event logging, you can ensure
      comprehensive logging of relevant activities. Additionally, enabling log file
      validation, multi-region trails, and configuring an S3 bucket for log storage
      are essential for maintaining an audit trail and supporting incident response
      efforts.

    literature: CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS
      that can play a crucial role in establishing incident response plans. It allows
      you to collect and analyze logs, metrics, and events from various AWS resources
      and applications. This data can be used to detect and respond to security incidents,
      such as unauthorized access attempts, system failures, or performance issues.
      By setting up CloudWatch alarms and integrating them with other AWS services
      like AWS Lambda or Amazon SNS, you can automate incident response actions, such
      as triggering notifications, executing remediation scripts, or invoking incident
      response workflows.
    name: CloudWatchResource
    reason: CloudWatch provides essential monitoring and logging capabilities that
      can be leveraged to detect security incidents and trigger appropriate response
      actions. By setting up alarms, metric filters, and log groups, you can monitor
      various aspects of your AWS resources and applications, and define automated
      actions to be taken when specific conditions are met, such as sending notifications
      or invoking incident response workflows.
