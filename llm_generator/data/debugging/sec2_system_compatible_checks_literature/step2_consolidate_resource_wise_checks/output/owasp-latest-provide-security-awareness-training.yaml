    literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement security awareness
      training for employees. The 'users' field path contains information about IAM
      users, including their access keys, MFA devices, and associated policies. By
      analyzing the policies attached to each user, you can identify if there are
      any policies related to security awareness training, such as mandatory training
      requirements or access restrictions based on training completion. Additionally,
      you can use the access key information to monitor user activity and ensure that
      only authorized users with proper training have access to sensitive resources.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides information about IAM users, their access keys,
      MFA devices, and associated policies, which can be used to implement and enforce
      security awareness training requirements.
