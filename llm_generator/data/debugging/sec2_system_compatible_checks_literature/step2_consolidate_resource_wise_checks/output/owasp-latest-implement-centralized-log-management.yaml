    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables centralized log management
      by recording AWS API calls and related events across multiple AWS services and
      regions. It provides a comprehensive audit trail of account activity, which
      can be analyzed to detect potential security incidents, troubleshoot operational
      issues, and comply with regulatory requirements. CloudTrail logs can be delivered
      to an Amazon S3 bucket for long-term storage and analysis.

    reason: AWS CloudTrail is a service specifically designed for centralized log
      management, capturing API activity across multiple AWS services and regions.
      By configuring CloudTrail trails and event selectors, organizations can collect
      and store logs in a centralized S3 bucket for analysis and auditing purposes.

    literature: AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects
      and manages log data from various AWS resources and applications. It provides
      centralized log management capabilities, allowing you to store, monitor, and
      analyze log data from multiple sources in a unified location. CloudWatch integrates
      with other AWS services, such as Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Amazon ECS, to
      collect and process log data. By implementing centralized log management with
      CloudWatch, you can gain visibility into system activities, detect security
      incidents, troubleshoot issues, and comply with regulatory requirements.
