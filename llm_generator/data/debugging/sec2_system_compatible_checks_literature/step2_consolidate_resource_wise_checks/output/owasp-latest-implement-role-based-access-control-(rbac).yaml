    literature: The AWS IAM Resource is a critical component for implementing Role-Based
      Access Control (RBAC) in AWS. IAM allows you to create users, groups, and roles
      with specific permissions to access AWS resources. By defining policies and
      attaching them to IAM entities, you can enforce least privilege access and ensure
      that users only have the necessary permissions to perform their job functions.

    reason: The IAM Resource provides the necessary components to implement RBAC,
      including policies, user identities, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices.
      By analyzing the policy statements, user ARNs, and MFA devices, you can validate
      if RBAC is properly configured and enforced.
