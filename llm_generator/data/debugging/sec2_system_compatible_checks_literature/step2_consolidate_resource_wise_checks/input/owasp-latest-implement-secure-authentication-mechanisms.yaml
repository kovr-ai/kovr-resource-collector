    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing secure authentication
      mechanisms as per the OWASP latest guidelines. IAM (Identity and Access Management)
      is the core authentication and authorization service in AWS that allows you
      to manage users, groups, roles, and their associated permissions. By properly
      configuring IAM policies, you can enforce secure authentication practices such
      as multi-factor authentication (MFA), password policies, and access controls.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides the necessary configuration options and settings
      to implement secure authentication mechanisms as recommended by OWASP. It allows
      you to enforce MFA, manage user credentials, and define granular access policies.
