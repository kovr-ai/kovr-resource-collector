    literature: The IAMResource in AWS can be used to implement regular security testing
      by analyzing the policies attached to IAM users and roles. By reviewing the
      policies, you can identify any overly permissive or risky permissions that could
      potentially be exploited by attackers. Additionally, you can check for compliance
      with least privilege principles and ensure that users and roles only have the
      necessary permissions required for their job functions.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM policies, user access keys, and
      MFA device information, which are crucial for assessing the security posture
      of an AWS account and identifying potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events for your account. It provides a log of activities that can be used for
      security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. By enabling
      CloudTrail and configuring it to capture relevant events, organizations can
      conduct regular security testing and assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities
      and ensure compliance with security standards.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-conduct-regular-security-testing'
      security check because it provides a comprehensive log of API activities and
      events, which can be used for security testing, vulnerability assessments, and
      compliance auditing.
