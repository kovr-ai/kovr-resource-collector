    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is relevant for implementing the 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations'
      security check. IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies define permissions
      for accessing AWS resources, including sensitive data. By analyzing IAM policies,
      you can identify potential areas of non-compliance with data protection regulations,
      such as overly permissive access to personal data or lack of proper access controls.
      Ensuring that IAM policies adhere to data protection regulations is crucial
      for maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive information.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM policies and user access keys,
      which are essential for evaluating compliance with data protection regulations.
      By analyzing the policy statements, actions, and resources, you can identify
      potential areas of non-compliance, such as overly permissive access to sensitive
      data or lack of proper access controls. Additionally, reviewing user access
      keys can help identify potential security risks and ensure that access to sensitive
      data is properly managed.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations' check is designed
      to ensure that AWS S3 buckets comply with data protection regulations and industry
      standards when handling sensitive information. S3 buckets can store various
      types of data, including personal or sensitive information, which may be subject
      to regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This check helps organizations identify
      potential areas of non-compliance in their S3 bucket configurations and take
      appropriate measures to protect sensitive data and maintain regulatory compliance.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: AWS S3 buckets can store sensitive data, and their configurations directly
      impact data protection and compliance with regulations. The provided field paths
      allow for checking encryption settings, public access controls, and other relevant
      configurations that determine compliance with data protection regulations.

    literature: The CloudTrailResource in AWS is relevant for implementing the 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations'
      security check. CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events, which can be used to monitor and audit access to sensitive data and
      resources. By configuring CloudTrail trails with appropriate event selectors
      and data resource types, organizations can capture and analyze events related
      to data access, modification, and transfer, helping them identify potential
      violations of data protection regulations and industry standards.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrailResource in AWS provides the necessary configuration options
      to capture and log events related to data access, modification, and transfer,
      which is essential for monitoring and auditing compliance with data protection
      regulations. By configuring appropriate event selectors, data resource types,
      and logging settings, organizations can ensure that relevant events are captured
      and analyzed for potential violations.
