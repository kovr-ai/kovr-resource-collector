    literature: The S3 resource in AWS is applicable for implementing encryption for
      data in transit as per the OWASP security check. S3 buckets can be configured
      to enforce encryption of data in transit using SSL/TLS when transferring data
      over the network. This ensures that all data transmitted to and from the S3
      bucket is encrypted, protecting it from unauthorized access or interception.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3 resource provides configuration options to enable encryption for
      data in transit using SSL/TLS. The relevant field paths are buckets[].encryption.enabled
      and buckets[].encryption.type, which allow specifying if encryption is enabled
      and the type of encryption used.
