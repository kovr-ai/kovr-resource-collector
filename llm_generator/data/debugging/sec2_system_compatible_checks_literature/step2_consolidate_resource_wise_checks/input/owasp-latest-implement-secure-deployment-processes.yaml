    literature: The IAM resource in AWS is relevant for implementing secure deployment
      processes. IAM policies define permissions for resources and actions, which
      can be used to enforce least privilege access and segregation of duties during
      deployments. Additionally, IAM user access keys and MFA devices relate to secure
      authentication and authorization controls for deployment personnel.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource contains critical configuration related to access controls,
      permissions, and authentication factors that directly impact the security of
      deployment processes.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is relevant for implementing secure deployment
      processes as it provides an audit trail of AWS API calls and related events.
      By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it properly, organizations can monitor
      and review activities across their AWS infrastructure, including deployments
      and changes made to resources. This visibility into deployment processes helps
      ensure proper security controls are applied and allows for investigation of
      potential security incidents.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: CloudTrail provides an audit trail of AWS API calls and related events,
      which is essential for monitoring and reviewing deployment activities across
      the AWS infrastructure. By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it properly,
      organizations can ensure secure deployment processes are followed and investigate
      any potential security incidents.
