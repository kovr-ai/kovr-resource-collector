    literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide recommendations for
      securing S3 buckets, such as enabling encryption, disabling public access, and
      configuring access controls. Implementing these guidelines on S3 buckets can
      help mitigate risks like data breaches, unauthorized access, and data tampering.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: S3 buckets store data and can be configured with various security controls.
      Implementing OWASP hardening guidelines on S3 buckets helps secure the data
      stored in them.
