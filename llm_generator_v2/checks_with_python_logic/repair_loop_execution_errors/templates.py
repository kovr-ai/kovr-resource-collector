PROMPT = """You are a cybersecurity compliance expert repairing failed Python validation logic.

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: CHECKS ARE PER INDIVIDUAL RESOURCE**
- Each check validates ONE resource instance at a time
- The fetched_value contains data from a SINGLE resource  
- Logic should determine if THIS ONE resource is compliant
- Do NOT try to aggregate or compare across multiple resources

**Check Information:**
- Check ID: {{check.unique_id}}
- Check Name: {{check.name}}
- Category: {{check.category}}
- Control Names: {{check.control_names}}

**Check Literature:**
{{check.literature}}

**Resource Information:**
- Resource Name: {{check.resource.name}}
- Field Paths Available: {{check.resource.field_paths}}
- Reason for Applicability: {{check.resource.reason}}

**Resource-Specific Literature:**
{{check.resource.literature}}

**üö® PREVIOUS VALIDATION ERRORS TO LEARN FROM:**
{{check.resource.errors}}

**ANALYSIS OF FAILURES:**
Based on the errors above, the previous logic had these issues:
1. Field path selection may have been inappropriate
2. Logic may not have handled the actual data format correctly
3. Edge cases may not have been properly handled
4. Compliance criteria may not have matched the actual requirements

**REPAIR STRATEGY:**
1. Choose a DIFFERENT field path from the available options if the previous one failed
2. Write logic that handles the specific error patterns shown above
3. Ensure proper handling of edge cases and data types
4. Focus on the actual compliance requirements from the literature

**üö® CRITICAL: FIELD PATH EXTRACTION BEHAVIOR üö®**

**IMPORTANT:** The field_path extracts ONLY specific data from the resource, NOT the full resource object!

**üö® CRITICAL: VARIABLE SCOPE IN CUSTOM LOGIC üö®**

**IMPORTANT:** In your custom logic, you can ONLY use these variables:
- `fetched_value` - the data extracted by the field_path
- `result` - the variable to set (True/False for compliance)

**‚ùå DO NOT use these variables (they don't exist):**
- `resource` - This variable is NOT available in custom logic scope
- Any other variable names not listed above

**üö® CRITICAL: PYDANTIC MODEL ACCESS üö®**

**IMPORTANT:** When field_path extracts nested data, the results may be **Pydantic model objects**, NOT Python dictionaries!

**‚úÖ BEST PRACTICE - Safe attribute/key access:**
```python
def safe_get(obj, key, default=None):
    \"\"\"Safely get value from dict or Pydantic object\"\"\"
    if hasattr(obj, key):
        return getattr(obj, key, default)
    elif isinstance(obj, dict):
        return obj.get(key, default)
    return default
```

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Choose ONE field path from the available paths: {{check.resource.field_paths}}
2. **IMPORTANT:** Choose a DIFFERENT field path than what was used before (if possible)
3. Generate Python logic that works with the extracted data format
4. Set result = True for compliance, result = False for non-compliance
5. Handle edge cases: None, empty lists, missing fields
6. **LEARN FROM THE ERRORS** - avoid the patterns that caused failures
7. Use the resource literature to determine compliance criteria
8. Logic must work with extracted data, NOT full resource

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Generate ONLY a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "field_path": "chosen_field_path_from_available_list", 
  "logic": "result = False\n\n# Your repaired Python logic here\n# Learn from the errors: {{check.resource.errors}}\nif fetched_value is None:\n    result = False\nelse:\n    # Implement improved compliance logic based on error analysis\n    pass"
}

Generate the JSON now:"""
