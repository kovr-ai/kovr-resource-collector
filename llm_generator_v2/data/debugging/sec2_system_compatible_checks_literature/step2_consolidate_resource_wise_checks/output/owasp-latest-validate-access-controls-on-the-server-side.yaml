    literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
      is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the
      server-side of an application. In the context of AWS IAM resources, this check
      can be implemented by analyzing the IAM policies and their statements to ensure
      that access controls are properly defined and enforced. The IAM policies define
      the permissions granted to users, groups, and roles, and their statements specify
      the actions, resources, and conditions under which those permissions are granted.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource is valid for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side'
      check because it provides access to the IAM policies and their statements, which
      define the access controls for users, groups, and roles. Additionally, the resource
      includes information about user access keys and multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) devices, which are relevant for validating access controls.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
      is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the
      server-side of an application. AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS
      API calls and related events, which can be used to monitor and audit access
      to AWS resources. By configuring CloudTrail trails and event selectors, you
      can capture and analyze API activity to ensure that access controls are properly
      enforced and that only authorized entities can perform specific actions on protected
      resources.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side'
      check because it allows you to capture and analyze API activity, including access
      control-related events, across AWS resources. By configuring CloudTrail trails
      and event selectors, you can monitor and audit access to ensure that access
      controls are properly enforced.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
      is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the
      server-side for the Google UserResource. This resource contains information
      about a user's account, including administrative privileges, contact details,
      and security settings. Proper access controls are crucial to ensure that only
      authorized users or entities can access and modify sensitive user data.
    name: UserResource
    reason: The UserResource contains fields related to user privileges, identities,
      and security settings, which are essential for implementing proper access controls
      on the server-side. By validating these fields, the security check can ensure
      that only authorized users can access and modify user data based on their assigned
      roles and permissions.
