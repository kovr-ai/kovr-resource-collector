    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing the owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies
      security check. This resource contains information about IAM users and their
      associated password policies. By analyzing the policies attached to IAM users
      and the policy statements within those policies, it is possible to validate
      if strong password requirements are enforced.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM user details, including their access
      keys and associated policies. By inspecting the policy statements and conditions,
      it is possible to determine if password complexity, expiration, and reuse requirements
      are enforced.
