    literature: AWS S3 buckets are a critical resource for storing data, and ensuring
      their resilience and availability is essential for maintaining business continuity
      in the event of a disaster. Establishing disaster recovery plans for S3 buckets
      involves implementing measures such as cross-region replication, versioning,
      and backup strategies to protect data integrity and enable rapid recovery in
      case of data loss or system failures.
