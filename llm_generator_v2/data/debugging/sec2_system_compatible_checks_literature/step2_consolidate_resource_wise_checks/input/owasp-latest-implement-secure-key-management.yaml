    literature: The IAM resource in AWS is relevant for implementing secure key management
      practices. IAM allows you to create and manage access keys, which are used to
      securely authenticate requests to AWS services. Proper management of these access
      keys is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and preventing unauthorized
      access. This resource provides the necessary controls to enforce secure key
      management practices, such as key rotation, key revocation, and access restrictions.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource provides access keys for authenticating requests to AWS
      services, and policies for controlling access permissions. These elements are
      essential for implementing secure key management practices, such as key rotation,
      revocation, and access restrictions.

    literature: The AWS S3 resource is applicable for implementing secure key management
      practices as per the OWASP security check. S3 buckets support server-side encryption
      using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys or Amazon S3 managed keys. Enabling
      encryption and using a customer-managed KMS key allows for secure key management
      and rotation.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3 resource provides fields to configure encryption and specify a
      KMS key for each bucket. This allows implementing secure key management practices
      such as using strong encryption algorithms, properly generating and storing
      keys, and regularly rotating keys.
