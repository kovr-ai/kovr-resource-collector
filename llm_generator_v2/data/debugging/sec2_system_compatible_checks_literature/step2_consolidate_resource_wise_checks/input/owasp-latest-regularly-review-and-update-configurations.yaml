    literature: The IAM resource in AWS is applicable for implementing the OWASP check
      'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'. IAM policies define
      permissions and access controls for AWS resources, and it is crucial to regularly
      review and update these policies to maintain a secure posture. Outdated or misconfigured
      IAM policies can lead to excessive permissions, unauthorized access, or security
      vulnerabilities.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource in AWS contains policies that define permissions and
      access controls for AWS resources. Regularly reviewing and updating these policies
      is essential to maintain a secure posture and comply with the OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'.

    literature: The AWS S3 resource is applicable for implementing the OWASP check
      'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'. S3 bucket configurations,
      such as encryption settings, public access controls, and versioning status,
      should be regularly reviewed and updated to maintain a secure posture. Outdated
      or misconfigured S3 buckets can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access,
      or non-compliance with security standards.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The AWS S3 resource provides configurations that should be regularly reviewed
      and updated to maintain a secure posture, aligning with the OWASP check's objective.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the OWASP
      check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'. CloudTrail
      is a service that records AWS API calls and related events, providing a log
      of account activity. By enabling CloudTrail and configuring it correctly, organizations
      can regularly review and audit the logs to identify potential misconfigurations,
      unauthorized access attempts, or other security-related events. This allows
      for timely updates and remediation of any identified issues, aligning with the
      security check's objective of maintaining an up-to-date and secure system configuration.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource provides a centralized logging mechanism for AWS
      account activity, enabling regular reviews and updates to system configurations
      based on the logged events. By configuring CloudTrail appropriately, organizations
      can ensure that relevant API calls and events are captured, allowing for comprehensive
      monitoring and timely remediation of any identified issues.
