    description: To implement the OWASP SSDLC security check, the organization needs
      to establish and follow a secure software development lifecycle that incorporates
      security practices and considerations throughout the entire software development
      process.
    estimated_time: The implementation time can vary depending on the size and complexity
      of the organization's software development processes, but it typically takes
      several months to establish and fully adopt an SSDLC framework.
    instructions:
    - Conduct a thorough assessment of the current software development practices
      and identify gaps or areas for improvement in terms of security.
    - Develop and implement a comprehensive SSDLC framework that covers all phases
      of the software development lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design,
      implementation, testing, and deployment.
    - Provide training and awareness programs for software developers, testers, and
      other relevant stakeholders on secure coding practices, security testing, and
      the importance of incorporating security throughout the development process.
    - Establish security review processes and checkpoints at various stages of the
      software development lifecycle to ensure that security considerations are properly
      addressed.
    - Continuously monitor and update the SSDLC framework based on industry best practices,
      emerging threats, and feedback from the development teams.

  literature: The Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a set of practices
    and guidelines for building secure software from the ground up. It covers various
    phases of the software development process, including requirements gathering,
    design, implementation, testing, and deployment. The SSDLC emphasizes incorporating
    security considerations throughout the entire lifecycle to proactively address
    security risks and vulnerabilities. However, the provided resource (EC2Resource)
    is an AWS EC2 instance, which is an infrastructure component rather than a software
    development process or artifact. Therefore, this resource is not directly applicable
    for implementing the OWASP SSDLC security check.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not adopted or does not follow a secure Software
      Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) that incorporates security considerations throughout
      the entire software development process.
    partial: The organization has partially adopted a secure Software Development
      Lifecycle (SSDLC), but there are gaps or areas for improvement in incorporating
      security considerations throughout the entire software development process.
    success: The organization has adopted and follows a secure Software Development
      Lifecycle (SSDLC) that incorporates security considerations throughout the entire
      software development process.
  reason: The EC2Resource represents an AWS EC2 instance, which is an infrastructure
    component. The OWASP SSDLC security check is focused on the software development
    lifecycle and practices, which is not directly related to the EC2 instance itself.
