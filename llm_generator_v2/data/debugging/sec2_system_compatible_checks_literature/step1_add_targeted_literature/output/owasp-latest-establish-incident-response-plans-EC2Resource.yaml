    description: Incident response plans should be established and maintained at the
      organizational level, separate from individual cloud resources.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the organization's size and complexity
    instructions:
    - Consult with your organization's security team or incident response team to
      review and update the existing incident response plans.
    - Ensure that the incident response plans cover all relevant aspects, including
      roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, incident handling procedures,
      and recovery strategies.
    - Regularly review and update the incident response plans to reflect changes in
      the organization's infrastructure, processes, and regulatory requirements.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to establishing incident
    response plans. Incident response plans are organizational policies and procedures
    that outline the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident or data
    breach. While EC2 instances and related resources are important components of
    an organization's cloud infrastructure, they do not inherently contain or implement
    incident response plans.

    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'Establish Incident Response

  reason: The EC2Resource represents Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances,
    networking components, and related resources. It does not contain information
    or configurations specific to incident response plans, which are typically documented
    and maintained separately at the organizational level.
