  check:
    unique_id: owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools
  field_paths: []
  fix_details:
    automation_available: false
    description: Since the resource is a GitHub repository, it does not directly implement
      or enforce the use of parameterized queries or ORM tools. However, any application
      code hosted in the repository should follow this security best practice.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the size and complexity of the application code.
    instructions:
    - 1. Review the application code in the repository for any database interactions.
    - 2. Identify areas where user input is used in SQL queries.
    - 3. Implement parameterized queries or use an ORM tool to separate user input
      from SQL statements.
    - 4. Follow secure coding practices and input validation to prevent SQL injection
      vulnerabilities.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    is focused on preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries
    or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools in application code. This check is primarily
    applicable to resources that involve database interactions and application code
    execution, such as web applications, serverless functions, or virtual machines
    running application code.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application code in the repository does not use parameterized queries
      or ORM tools, leaving it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The application code in the repository uses parameterized queries or
      ORM tools to prevent SQL injection attacks.
  reason: The provided resource 'GithubResource' is a GitHub repository, which does
    not directly involve application code execution or database interactions. GitHub
    repositories are primarily used for version control, collaboration, and hosting
    source code. While secure coding practices like using parameterized queries or
    ORM tools are important for any application code hosted in the repository, the
    repository itself does not directly implement or enforce these practices.
