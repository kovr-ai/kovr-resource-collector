  literature: The provided resource is a GitHub repository, which contains information
    about the repository itself, such as its code, branches, collaborators, and security
    settings. While this resource provides some security-related data, it does not
    directly address the process of regularly reviewing and updating security guidelines
    based on the OWASP Top 10 or other industry standards.
