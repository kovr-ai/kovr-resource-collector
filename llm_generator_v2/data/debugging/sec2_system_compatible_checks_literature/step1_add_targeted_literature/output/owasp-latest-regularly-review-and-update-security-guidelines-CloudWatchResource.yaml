    description: Configure CloudWatch to monitor and alert on security-related events
      and metrics relevant to the OWASP Top 10 or other security frameworks.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Identify security-related events and metrics to monitor based on the OWASP Top
      10 or other security frameworks.
    - Create CloudWatch Logs log groups and metric filters to capture relevant security
      events and metrics.
    - Create CloudWatch Alarms to monitor and alert on security-related metrics and
      events.
    - Configure appropriate notification and remediation actions for the CloudWatch
      Alarms.
    - Regularly review and update the CloudWatch monitoring and alerting configuration
      based on emerging security threats and updated security guidelines.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is a monitoring and observability service
    that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. While CloudWatch itself does not directly implement security
    guidelines or controls, it can be used to monitor and alert on security-related
    events and metrics, which can aid in the regular review and update of security
    guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10 or other security frameworks.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not configured to monitor and alert on security-related
      events and metrics, hindering the regular review and update of security guidelines.
    partial: CloudWatch is partially configured to monitor and alert on security-related
      events and metrics, but additional configuration is needed to fully support
      the regular review and update of security guidelines.
    success: CloudWatch is configured to monitor and alert on security-related events
      and metrics, enabling regular review and update of security guidelines.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is primarily a monitoring and observability service
    and does not directly implement or manage security guidelines or controls. However,
    it can be used to monitor security-related events and metrics, which can aid in
    the regular review and update of security guidelines.
