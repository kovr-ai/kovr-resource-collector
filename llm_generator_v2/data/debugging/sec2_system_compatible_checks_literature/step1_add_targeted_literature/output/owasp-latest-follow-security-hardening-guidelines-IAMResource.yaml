    description: While the IAMResource does not directly implement the OWASP security
      hardening guidelines, it is still important to follow best practices for IAM
      configurations to ensure proper access control and authentication.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review IAM policies and ensure they follow the principle of least privilege,
      granting only the necessary permissions.
    - Regularly rotate and manage access keys for IAM users.
    - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users with privileged access.
    - Implement centralized identity management and single sign-on (SSO) for better
      user access control.

  literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide best practices for securing
    web applications and systems, covering areas such as authentication, access control,
    input validation, and secure coding practices. However, the IAMResource in AWS
    is primarily focused on managing Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies,
    users, and access keys. While following security best practices is important for
    IAM configurations, this resource does not directly implement or validate adherence
    to the OWASP security hardening guidelines, which are more applicable to web application
    and system configurations.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM policies, users, and access keys do not follow the OWASP security
      hardening guidelines.
    partial: The IAM policies, users, and access keys partially follow the OWASP security
      hardening guidelines.
    success: The IAM policies, users, and access keys follow the OWASP security hardening
      guidelines.
  reason: The IAMResource in AWS is focused on managing IAM policies, users, and access
    keys, which are important for access control and authentication, but do not directly
    implement or validate adherence to the comprehensive OWASP security hardening
    guidelines for web applications and systems.
