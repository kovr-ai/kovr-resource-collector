  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
    is focused on preventing XML External Entity (XXE) attacks by disabling external
    entity processing in applications that parse XML input. This check is primarily
    applicable to web applications, application servers, or services that handle XML
    data processing. The AWS S3 resource provided is a storage service for hosting
    objects and files, and it does not directly handle XML parsing or processing.
    Therefore, this security check is not directly applicable to the S3 resource.

    partial: This check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service for hosting objects and files,
    and it does not directly handle XML parsing or processing. The security check
    'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing' is focused on preventing
    XXE attacks in applications that parse XML input, which is not a primary function
    of the S3 service.
