    description: To assess the secure configuration of databases, you need to analyze
      resources specifically related to the database service being used (e.g., RDS
      for AWS).
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - Identify the database service and resources being used in your cloud environment.
    - Locate the appropriate resource in the Cloud Security Command Center that provides
      information about database configurations.
    - Analyze the resource and its field paths to determine if it contains the necessary
      information to assess the secure configuration of databases.
    - If a suitable resource is found, perform the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-databases'
      security check on that resource.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to the configuration
    of databases. It provides information about Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances,
    networking components, and other resources associated with the EC2 service. While
    EC2 instances can host databases, the resource itself does not contain specific
    details about database configurations.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resources do not provide information about database configurations,
      and therefore, this check cannot be performed.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the EC2Resource.
    success: The EC2 resources are configured securely, and the associated databases
      have secure configurations.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain any information related to the configuration
    settings of databases, which is the focus of the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-databases'
    security check. This resource is primarily concerned with EC2 instances, networking
    components, and other EC2-related resources, but not database configurations.
