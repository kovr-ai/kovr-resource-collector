    description: To implement secure authentication mechanisms, you need to configure
      and integrate appropriate authentication services or libraries within your application.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of the application and the chosen
      authentication solution.
    instructions:
    - Evaluate your application's authentication requirements and choose a suitable
      authentication service or library (e.g., Google Cloud Identity Platform, Firebase
      Authentication, or third-party libraries).
    - Implement secure authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication,
      password policies, brute-force protection, and session management.
    - Regularly review and update authentication mechanisms to address new threats
      and vulnerabilities.
    - Implement secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) to protect authentication
      data in transit.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a collection of
    entities, such as users or other groups. It does not directly relate to implementing
    secure authentication mechanisms for an application. Secure authentication mechanisms
    are typically implemented within the application code or through identity and
    access management services like Google Cloud Identity Platform or Firebase Authentication.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure authentication mechanisms,
      leaving it vulnerable to authentication attacks.
    partial: Some authentication mechanisms are implemented, but additional measures
      are needed to fully secure the authentication process.
    success: The application implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect
      against common authentication attacks.
  reason: The GroupResource is a data structure for managing groups and their members.
    It does not provide functionality for implementing authentication mechanisms or
    securing an application's authentication process.
