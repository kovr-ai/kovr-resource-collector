    description: To address the lack of a regular security procedure review and update
      process, your organization should establish a formal program with defined roles,
      responsibilities, and timelines.
    estimated_time: 2-3 months for initial implementation, ongoing effort
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify key stakeholders and assign responsibilities for security procedure
      reviews and updates.
    - 2. Define the scope and frequency of reviews (e.g., quarterly, annually) based
      on your organization's risk profile and industry best practices.
    - 3. Establish a process for gathering input from relevant teams (e.g., security,
      operations, compliance) and external sources (e.g., threat intelligence, industry
      groups).
    - 4. Develop a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of existing security
      procedures and identifying areas for improvement.
    - 5. Implement a change management process for updating security procedures and
      communicating changes to relevant personnel.
    - 6. Regularly review and update the security procedure review and update process
      itself to ensure its continued effectiveness.

  literature: The provided resource (AWS EC2) does not directly relate to the security
    check of regularly reviewing and updating security procedures. EC2 is an Infrastructure
    as a Service (IaaS) offering that provides virtual computing resources, but it
    does not inherently address the process of reviewing and updating security procedures
    within an organization.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization does not have a consistent process for regularly reviewing
      and updating security procedures, leaving you potentially vulnerable to emerging
      threats and non-compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.
    partial: Your organization partially reviews and updates security procedures,
      but the process is not comprehensive or consistently followed across all areas
      of your security operations.
    success: Your organization has a well-defined process in place to regularly review
      and update security procedures, ensuring that your security posture remains
      effective and aligned with the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices.
  reason: The security check focuses on the organizational process of regularly reviewing
    and updating security procedures, which is not a specific feature or capability
    of the EC2 service. While EC2 instances and related resources may be part of the
    overall infrastructure that needs to be considered during security reviews, the
    EC2 resource itself does not directly implement or support the process of reviewing
    and updating security procedures.
