    description: 'If IAM logging mechanisms are not properly configured, follow these
      steps to enable comprehensive logging:'
    estimated_time: 1 hour
    instructions:
    - Enable AWS CloudTrail to capture IAM events such as policy changes, access key
      creation/deletion, and MFA device assignments.
    - Configure CloudTrail to deliver logs to a secure and centralized log storage
      solution (e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch Logs).
    - Set up log monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious
      activities or policy violations.
    - Implement log retention policies to comply with organizational and regulatory
      requirements.

  literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing comprehensive
    logging mechanisms as it contains information about IAM policies, user access
    keys, and MFA devices. Logging changes to IAM policies, access key usage, and
    MFA device assignments can provide visibility into privileged activities and potential
    security risks. This aligns with the OWASP recommendation for maintaining audit
    trails of system events and user actions.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: IAM logging mechanisms are not configured or are missing critical components
      for auditing privileged activities.
    partial: IAM logging mechanisms are partially configured but may be missing some
      components for comprehensive auditing.
    success: IAM logging mechanisms are properly configured to capture policy changes,
      access key usage, and MFA device assignments.
  reason: The IAMResource contains details about IAM policies, user access keys, and
    MFA devices, which are critical components for auditing and logging privileged
    access and changes to security controls. Monitoring these elements can help detect
    and respond to potential security incidents.
