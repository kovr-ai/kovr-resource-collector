    description: To implement an SCA process, you need to analyze the application
      code and its dependencies, which is not directly related to the EC2 resource.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement an SCA process can vary depending
      on the complexity of your applications and the SCA tool or service you choose
      to use.
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the applications running on your EC2 instances that require SCA.
    - 2. Implement an SCA tool or service that can analyze the application code and
      its dependencies.
    - 3. Integrate the SCA process into your software development lifecycle (SDLC)
      or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
    - 4. Regularly scan your applications for known vulnerabilities and licensing
      issues using the SCA tool.
    - 5. Address any identified vulnerabilities or licensing issues according to your
      organization's policies and procedures.

  literature: The EC2 resource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing a Software
    Composition Analysis (SCA) process. SCA is a process that analyzes the open source
    and third-party components used in an application to identify potential risks
    and vulnerabilities. The EC2 resource represents Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud
    service, which provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. While EC2 instances
    can be used to run applications that may require SCA, the EC2 resource itself
    does not provide functionality for implementing an SCA process.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    success: This resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
  reason: The EC2 resource does not have any field paths related to implementing an
    SCA process. SCA is typically performed at the application level, analyzing the
    software components and dependencies used in the application code. The EC2 resource
    represents the underlying compute infrastructure, which is separate from the application
    code and its dependencies.
