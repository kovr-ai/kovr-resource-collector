    description: To implement secure session management, you need to configure your
      web application and its underlying infrastructure components (e.g., load balancers,
      web servers, application servers) to follow best practices for session management.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the web application and
      infrastructure.
    instructions:
    - Review the OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet for detailed guidance on implementing
      secure session management practices.
    - Ensure that your web application generates unpredictable session identifiers
      and protects session data from tampering.
    - Configure appropriate session timeouts and automatically invalidate sessions
      after logout or inactivity.
    - Implement additional security measures such as session fixation protection,
      secure cookie attributes, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection.

  literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is used for logging and monitoring API activity
    within an AWS account. While it can provide valuable audit trails, it does not
    directly implement secure session management practices for web applications. Secure
    session management involves protecting user sessions from unauthorized access,
    hijacking, and other attacks by generating unpredictable session identifiers,
    protecting session data from tampering, setting appropriate session timeouts,
    and invalidating sessions after logout or inactivity.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudTrail resource does not implement secure session management
      practices for web applications.
    partial: The CloudTrail resource does not directly address secure session management,
      but it can provide valuable audit logs for monitoring and investigating potential
      session-related issues.
    success: The CloudTrail resource is configured to log and monitor API activity,
      providing an audit trail for security analysis.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is focused on logging and monitoring API activity,
    rather than implementing secure session management for web applications. It does
    not have the necessary functionality to handle session management tasks such as
    generating session identifiers, protecting session data, or managing session timeouts
    and invalidation.
