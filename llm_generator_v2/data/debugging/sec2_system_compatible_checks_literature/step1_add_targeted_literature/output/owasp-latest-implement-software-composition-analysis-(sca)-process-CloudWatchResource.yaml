    description: To implement an SCA process, you need to use a dedicated tool or
      service specifically designed for software composition analysis.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - Evaluate and select an SCA tool or service that meets your organization's requirements.
    - Integrate the chosen SCA solution into your software development lifecycle (SDLC)
      and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
    - Configure the SCA tool to scan your application codebase and dependencies for
      known vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and outdated components.
    - Review and address the findings from the SCA scans, prioritizing critical vulnerabilities
      and licensing violations.
    - Establish a process for regularly scanning and monitoring your applications
      using the SCA tool.

  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, such as creating alarms, dashboards, and log groups. It does not directly
    relate to implementing a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) process, which involves
    identifying and analyzing open source and third-party components used in an application
    codebase. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor the performance and health of
    applications, it does not provide functionality for scanning application dependencies
    and identifying potential vulnerabilities or licensing issues.

  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource is not suitable for implementing an SCA process.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource is not suitable for implementing an SCA process.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to support an SCA process.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process
    as it is a monitoring and observability service, not a tool for analyzing application
    dependencies and vulnerabilities.
