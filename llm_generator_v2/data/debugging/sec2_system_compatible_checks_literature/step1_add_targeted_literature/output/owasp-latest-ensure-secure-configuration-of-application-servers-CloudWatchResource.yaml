    description: To ensure secure configuration of application servers, you need to
      review and harden the security settings of each server, following industry best
      practices and vendor-specific hardening guidelines.
    estimated_time: The time required can vary depending on the number of application
      servers and the complexity of the environment. It may take several hours to
      several days to complete the hardening process.
    instructions:
    - Identify all application servers in your environment.
    - Review the security configuration of each server, including network settings,
      access controls, encryption, and other security features.
    - Implement recommended hardening measures based on industry best practices and
      vendor guidelines.
    - Regularly monitor and update the security configurations as new vulnerabilities
      and threats emerge.

  literature: The CloudWatchResource in AWS does not directly relate to the secure
    configuration of application servers. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability
    service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor the performance and
    health of application servers, it does not directly configure or harden the security
    settings of those servers.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more application servers have insecure configurations, which could
      lead to vulnerabilities such as unintended data exposure, remote code execution,
      and privilege escalation.
    partial: Some application servers are configured securely, but others have insecure
      configurations that need to be addressed.
    success: The application servers are configured securely, following industry best
      practices and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The CloudWatchResource is a monitoring and observability service, and does
    not directly manage or configure the security settings of application servers.
    Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-application-servers'
    security check.
