  literature: The provided resource is a GitHub repository, which does not directly
    relate to implementing secure password recovery mechanisms. This security check
    is focused on ensuring that web applications have robust processes for allowing
    users to reset their passwords securely, such as sending password reset links
    to verified email addresses or using security questions. The GitHub resource contains
    information about the repository itself, its branches, collaborators, security
    advisories, and other metadata, but does not provide details about the application's
    authentication or password recovery mechanisms.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not implement secure password recovery mechanisms,
      leaving user accounts vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application implements secure password recovery mechanisms, such
      as sending password reset links to verified email addresses or using security
      questions.
  reason: The GitHub repository resource does not contain information relevant to
    implementing secure password recovery mechanisms for a web application. This security
    check is focused on application-level authentication and password management processes,
    which are not directly related to the data provided by the GitHub API for a repository.
