    description: This resource is not suitable for implementing password strength
      requirements. You should look for resources or services specifically related
      to user management, authentication, or identity and access management (IAM)
      in Google Cloud.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the specific service or resource used.
    instructions:
    - Identify the appropriate Google Cloud service or resource for managing user
      accounts and authentication policies.
    - Consult the documentation or seek guidance from Google Cloud support to understand
      how to implement password strength requirements within that service or resource.
    - Configure the relevant settings or policies to enforce the desired password
      strength requirements, such as minimum length, complexity rules, and regular
      password changes.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to implementing password strength requirements. This resource represents a group
    of users or entities within an organization, and its fields contain information
    about the group's metadata, membership details, and source connector. It does
    not seem to have any fields or functionality specifically related to password
    policies or authentication mechanisms.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for implementing password strength requirements.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for implementing password strength requirements.
    success: This resource is not applicable for implementing password strength requirements.
  reason: The GroupResource is primarily used for managing groups and their membership
    information, but it does not have any direct connection to password strength requirements
    or authentication mechanisms. Password policies and strength requirements are
    typically implemented at the authentication layer or user management level, which
    is not the primary purpose of this resource.
