  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
    is focused on ensuring that web applications properly encode user input to prevent
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This check is primarily applicable to web
    applications and their server-side code, which is responsible for rendering and
    encoding user input before displaying it on web pages. The AWS S3 resource, on
    the other hand, is an object storage service that is not directly involved in
    rendering web content or handling user input. Therefore, this security check is
    not directly applicable to the S3 resource.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is an object storage service and does not handle user
    input or render web content. As such, it is not directly relevant to the security
    check for implementing output encoding to prevent XSS attacks, which is primarily
    focused on web applications and their server-side code.
