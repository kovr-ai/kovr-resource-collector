  literature: The OWASP latest use industry standard authentication protocols check
    is focused on ensuring that applications use industry-standard authentication
    protocols and mechanisms to authenticate users and protect their credentials.
    This check is primarily applicable to application-level resources that handle
    user authentication and authorization, such as web applications, APIs, or identity
    and access management services.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use industry-standard authentication protocols
      and mechanisms to authenticate users and protect their credentials, making it
      vulnerable to various attacks.
    partial: Not applicable for this resource.
    success: The application uses industry-standard authentication protocols and mechanisms
      to authenticate users and protect their credentials.
  reason: The provided resource, AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service), is an object storage
    service primarily used for storing and retrieving data. It does not directly handle
    user authentication or authorization mechanisms. Therefore, this resource is not
    applicable for implementing the OWASP latest use industry standard authentication
    protocols check.
