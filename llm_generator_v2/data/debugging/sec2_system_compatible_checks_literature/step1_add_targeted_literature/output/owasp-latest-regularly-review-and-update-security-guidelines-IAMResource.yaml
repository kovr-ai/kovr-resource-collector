    description: Since the AWS IAM Resource is not directly applicable for implementing
      this security check, the recommended approach is to focus on the web applications
      themselves and their associated security controls.
    estimated_time: Ongoing effort, depending on the number and complexity of web
      applications.
    instructions:
    - Identify the web applications in your environment that require OWASP Top 10
      security guidelines.
    - Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the security guidelines
      for these web applications based on the latest OWASP Top 10 recommendations.
    - Implement appropriate security controls and configurations within the web applications
      to address the OWASP Top 10 risks.
    - Continuously monitor and assess the web applications for compliance with the
      updated security guidelines.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The provided security check relates to regularly reviewing and updating
    security guidelines based on the OWASP Top 10 standard for web application security.
    However, the AWS IAM Resource is primarily focused on managing access and permissions
    for AWS resources, rather than web application security guidelines. While IAM
    policies can be used to restrict access to specific AWS services or actions, they
    do not directly address the implementation of OWASP Top 10 guidelines within web
    applications.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM policies do not address the regular review and update of OWASP
      Top 10 security guidelines for web applications.
    partial: The IAM policies partially address the regular review and update of OWASP
      Top 10 security guidelines for web applications, but additional measures are
      needed.
    success: The IAM policies are regularly reviewed and updated to align with the
      latest OWASP Top 10 security guidelines for web applications.
  reason: The AWS IAM Resource is not directly applicable for implementing the security
    check related to regularly reviewing and updating OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
    for web applications. IAM policies govern access to AWS resources, but do not
    specifically address web application security guidelines.
