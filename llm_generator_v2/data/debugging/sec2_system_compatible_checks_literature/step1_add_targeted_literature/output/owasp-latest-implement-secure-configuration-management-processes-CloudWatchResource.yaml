    description: To fully implement secure configuration management processes, additional
      tools and processes are required beyond just using AWS CloudWatch.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - Implement a configuration management tool (e.g., AWS Config, Terraform, Ansible)
      to track and manage configuration changes.
    - Establish a change management process that includes testing, approving, and
      deploying changes in a controlled manner.
    - Use CloudWatch alarms and dashboards to monitor for unauthorized or unintended
      configuration changes.
    - Integrate CloudWatch with other monitoring and logging tools to provide comprehensive
      visibility into configuration changes.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, such as creating alarms, dashboards, and log groups. While it can be
    used to monitor configuration changes and trigger alerts, it does not directly
    implement secure configuration management processes as described in the security
    check. Secure configuration management processes involve tracking, testing, approving,
    and deploying changes in a controlled manner, which typically requires additional
    tools and processes beyond just monitoring.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS CloudWatch resource does not directly implement secure configuration
      management processes. Additional tools and processes are required to meet this
      security check.
    partial: The AWS CloudWatch resource can be used to monitor configuration changes
      and trigger alerts, but does not fully implement secure configuration management
      processes.
    success: The AWS CloudWatch resource is configured to support secure configuration
      management processes.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is primarily focused on monitoring and observability,
    and does not directly implement secure configuration management processes as described
    in the security check. While it can be used to monitor configuration changes and
    trigger alerts, it does not provide the necessary functionality for tracking,
    testing, approving, and deploying changes in a controlled manner.
