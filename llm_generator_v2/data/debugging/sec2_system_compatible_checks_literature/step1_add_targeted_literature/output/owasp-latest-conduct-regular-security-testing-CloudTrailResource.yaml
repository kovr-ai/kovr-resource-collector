    description: If CloudTrail is not configured properly, it may not capture all
      relevant events and activities, making it difficult to conduct comprehensive
      security testing and assessments.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes
    instructions:
    - Review the CloudTrail trail configurations and ensure that relevant event selectors
      and data resources are enabled.
    - Enable log file validation to ensure the integrity of CloudTrail logs.
    - Configure CloudTrail to capture management events and read/write events as needed.
    - Consider enabling multi-region trails to capture events across multiple AWS
      regions.

  literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related events
    for your account. It provides a log of activities that can be used for security
    analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. By enabling CloudTrail
    and configuring it to capture relevant events, organizations can conduct regular
    security testing and assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure
    compliance with security standards.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to capture relevant events and activities,
      hindering regular security testing and assessments.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to capture events and activities,
      but additional configuration may be required for comprehensive security testing
      and assessments.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to capture relevant events and activities, enabling
      regular security testing and assessments.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-conduct-regular-security-testing'
    security check because it provides a comprehensive log of API activities and events,
    which can be used for security testing, vulnerability assessments, and compliance
    auditing.
