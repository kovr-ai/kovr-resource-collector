    description: Since the UserResource does not handle password storage or hashing,
      this security check is not applicable to this resource. To implement secure
      password hashing, you would need to analyze and potentially modify the authentication
      and user management components of your application.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the complexity of your application and authentication
      mechanisms.
    instructions:
    - Identify the components or services responsible for user authentication and
      password storage in your application.
    - Review the password hashing implementation and ensure it uses a secure, modern
      algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
    - Verify that the hashing implementation includes appropriate cost factors and
      salting to increase the computational cost of brute-force attacks.
    - Update or replace any outdated or insecure password hashing mechanisms with
      a secure implementation.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The UserResource in Google Cloud does not appear to contain any information
    related to password hashing or authentication mechanisms. This resource represents
    user account information such as names, emails, and organizational details, but
    does not include any fields related to password storage or hashing algorithms.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource does not contain any information related to password
      hashing or authentication mechanisms.
    partial: The UserResource partially implements password hashing, but the algorithm
      or implementation details are not clear.
    success: The UserResource implements secure password hashing using a modern algorithm
      like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
  reason: The UserResource does not contain any fields or properties related to password
    hashing or authentication mechanisms. It is primarily focused on storing user
    account information and metadata, but does not handle sensitive data like passwords
    or their hashing.
