    description: 'If the CloudWatch service is not properly configured for comprehensive
      monitoring, the following steps can be taken to remediate the issue:'
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review the existing CloudWatch Alarms and ensure that they cover critical metrics
      and thresholds related to security events, unauthorized access attempts, and
      potential data breaches.
    - Create additional CloudWatch Alarms as needed to monitor relevant metrics and
      trigger notifications or automated actions when security-related thresholds
      are breached.
    - Configure CloudWatch Logs to centralize and analyze log data from various AWS
      services and applications, enabling the identification of potential security
      incidents or unauthorized access attempts.
    - Set appropriate log retention periods for CloudWatch Log Groups to ensure that
      log data is available for investigation and analysis when needed.
    - Integrate CloudWatch Alarms and Logs with other security monitoring tools or
      incident response processes to ensure timely detection and response to security
      events.

  literature: The AWS CloudWatch service provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities
    for AWS resources and applications. It allows you to collect and track metrics,
    log data, and set alarms to detect anomalies or specific conditions. By configuring
    CloudWatch Alarms, you can monitor various aspects of your AWS environment and
    receive notifications or trigger automated actions when predefined thresholds
    are breached. Additionally, CloudWatch Logs can be used to centralize and analyze
    log data from various sources, enabling you to identify potential security incidents
    or unauthorized access attempts.

  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS CloudWatch service is not properly configured to monitor security
      events and potential threats across the AWS environment. Alarms and log groups
      are missing or misconfigured.
    partial: The AWS CloudWatch service is partially configured to monitor security
      events and potential threats across the AWS environment. Some alarms and log
      groups are set up, but additional configuration is required.
    success: The AWS CloudWatch service is properly configured with alarms and log
      groups to monitor security events and potential threats across the AWS environment.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch service provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities
    that align with the security check's requirement for implementing robust monitoring
    mechanisms. By configuring CloudWatch Alarms and analyzing CloudWatch Logs, organizations
    can detect and respond to security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and
    potential data breaches across their AWS infrastructure and applications.
