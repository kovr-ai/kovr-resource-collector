    description: To implement encryption for data at rest, you need to configure encryption
      on the specific storage services used, such as EBS volumes, S3 buckets, or RDS
      databases.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number of storage
      services and the complexity of your environment.
    instructions:
    - Identify all storage services used in your AWS environment that store sensitive
      data.
    - For each storage service, enable encryption at rest using industry-standard
      encryption algorithms and key management practices.
    - Regularly review and audit your encryption configurations to ensure compliance
      and address any changes or updates.

  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly handle data encryption at rest.
    It provides information about EC2 instances, networking resources, and other related
    components, but does not manage the encryption of data stored on EBS volumes or
    other storage services. To implement encryption for data at rest, you would need
    to configure encryption on the specific storage services used, such as EBS volumes,
    S3 buckets, or RDS databases.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more storage resources have data at rest that is not encrypted.
    partial: Some data at rest is encrypted, but not all storage resources are configured
      for encryption.
    success: All data at rest is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms
      and key management practices.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not directly manage encryption settings for data at
    rest. It provides information about EC2 instances and related resources, but the
    actual encryption configuration needs to be done on the storage services themselves.
