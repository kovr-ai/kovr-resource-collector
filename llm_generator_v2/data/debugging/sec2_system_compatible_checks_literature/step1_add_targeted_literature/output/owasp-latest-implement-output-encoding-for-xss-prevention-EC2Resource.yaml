  literature: The EC2Resource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing output
    encoding for XSS prevention. This security check is primarily applicable to web
    applications and services that render user input on web pages. EC2 instances can
    host web applications, but the resource itself does not provide functionality
    for output encoding or XSS prevention.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
      security check.
  reason: The EC2Resource represents Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, networking
    components, and related resources in an AWS account. It does not contain any fields
    or configurations specific to web application security or output encoding mechanisms
    for preventing XSS vulnerabilities.
