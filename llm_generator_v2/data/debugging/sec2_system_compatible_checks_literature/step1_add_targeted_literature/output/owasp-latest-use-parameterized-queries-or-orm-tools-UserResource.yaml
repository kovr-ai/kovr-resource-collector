  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    is focused on preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries
    or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools in application code. This check is primarily
    applicable to application code that interacts with databases and handles user
    input. The provided Google UserResource does not appear to be related to application
    code or database interactions. It seems to be a resource representing user information
    and settings within the Google Cloud environment.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application code does not use parameterized queries or ORM tools,
      leaving it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application code uses parameterized queries or ORM tools to prevent
      SQL injection attacks.
  reason: The Google UserResource does not contain any information related to application
    code, database interactions, or user input handling. It is a resource representing
    user data and settings, which is not relevant for implementing this specific security
    check.
