    description: This security check is not applicable to AWS CloudWatch resources.
      It should be implemented in application code and databases that handle user
      input and execute SQL queries.
    estimated_time: Varies based on the size and complexity of the application codebase.
    instructions:
    - Review your application code and identify areas where user input is used to
      construct SQL queries.
    - Implement parameterized queries or use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool
      to separate user input from SQL statements.
    - Follow secure coding practices and input validation techniques to prevent SQL
      injection vulnerabilities.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
    is focused on preventing SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries
    or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools in application code. This check is primarily
    applicable to application code and databases, rather than cloud resources like
    AWS CloudWatch.

  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools'
      security check.
  reason: AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects and
    manages log data, metrics, and alarms. It does not directly handle application
    code or database queries. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing
    the 'owasp-latest-use-parameterized-queries-or-orm-tools' security check.
