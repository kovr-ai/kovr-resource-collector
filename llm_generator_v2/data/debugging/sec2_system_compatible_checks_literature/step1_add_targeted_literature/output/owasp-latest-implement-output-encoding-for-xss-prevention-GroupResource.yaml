  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of users,
    which is primarily used for managing access control and permissions. This resource
    does not directly relate to implementing output encoding for XSS prevention, as
    it does not handle user input or output rendering in web applications.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource is not applicable for implementing output encoding
      for XSS prevention.
    partial: The GroupResource is not applicable for implementing output encoding
      for XSS prevention.
    success: The GroupResource is not applicable for implementing output encoding
      for XSS prevention.
  reason: The GroupResource is not applicable for implementing output encoding for
    XSS prevention because it is not a web application resource that handles user
    input or output rendering. This security check is specifically designed for web
    applications that need to sanitize and encode user input to prevent Cross-Site
    Scripting (XSS) attacks.
