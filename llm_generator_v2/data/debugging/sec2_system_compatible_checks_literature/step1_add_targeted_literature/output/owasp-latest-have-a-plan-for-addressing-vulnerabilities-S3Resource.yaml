    description: To address this issue, your organization should develop and implement
      a comprehensive vulnerability management plan that covers the identification,
      assessment, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities in applications

    - Develop a risk-based approach to prioritize and address identified vulnerabilities.
    - Implement procedures for testing and deploying security patches and updates.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-have-a-plan-for-addressing-vulnerabilities' security
    check is designed to ensure that organizations have a documented plan for addressing
    vulnerabilities in their applications and systems. This check is primarily focused
    on the organizational processes and policies related to vulnerability management,
    rather than the configuration of specific cloud resources.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: Your organization does not have a documented plan for addressing vulnerabilities
      in applications and systems. This increases the risk of security incidents and
      data breaches.
    partial: N/A
    success: Your organization has a well-defined and documented plan for addressing
      vulnerabilities in applications and systems.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service for hosting and managing data objects.
    It does not directly relate to an organization's vulnerability management plan
    or processes. While S3 buckets may store application data or logs that could be
    relevant in the context of vulnerability management, the resource itself does
    not provide information about the organization's vulnerability management plan
    or its implementation.
