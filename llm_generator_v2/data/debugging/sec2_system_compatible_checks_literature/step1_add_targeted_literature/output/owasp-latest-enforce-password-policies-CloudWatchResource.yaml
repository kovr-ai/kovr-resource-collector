    description: Since the CloudWatch resource is not applicable for enforcing password
      policies, no specific fix is required. However, you should review and ensure
      that password policies are properly configured and enforced within the relevant
      authentication and identity management services in your AWS environment.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
    instructions:
    - 1. Review the password policy settings in AWS IAM for your user accounts.
    - 2. If you are using external identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, SAML,
      or OpenID Connect), review and configure the password policies within those
      providers.
    - 3. Ensure that password policies meet your organization's security requirements
      and industry best practices.
    - 4. Regularly review and update password policies as needed to maintain strong
      authentication mechanisms.

  literature: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes within the AWS ecosystem. It allows you to collect and analyze metrics,
    logs, and events from various AWS services and applications. While CloudWatch
    provides valuable insights into the operational health and performance of your
    AWS resources, it does not directly enforce password policies or authentication
    mechanisms. Password policies are typically managed at the service level (e.g.,
    AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for user accounts) or through external
    identity providers integrated with AWS.

    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies'
      security check.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is not directly applicable for implementing the
    'owasp-latest-enforce-password-policies' security check, as it does not have the
    capability to enforce password policies or manage authentication mechanisms. This
    security check is more relevant to resources that handle user authentication and
    account management, such as IAM or identity providers.
