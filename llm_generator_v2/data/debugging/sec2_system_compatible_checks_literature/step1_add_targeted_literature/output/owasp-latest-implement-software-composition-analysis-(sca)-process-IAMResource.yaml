    description: To implement an SCA process, you need to use tools and services specifically
      designed for software composition analysis, such as open source or commercial
      SCA solutions.
    estimated_time: The time required to implement an SCA process can vary depending
      on the size and complexity of your application, the chosen SCA tool or service,
      and the level of integration required with your existing development processes.
    instructions:
    - Evaluate and select an appropriate SCA tool or service that meets your organization's
      requirements.
    - Integrate the SCA tool or service into your software development lifecycle (SDLC)
      and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
    - Configure the SCA tool or service to scan your application codebase and dependencies
      for known vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and outdated or unsupported components.
    - Review the SCA reports and take appropriate actions to address identified issues,
      such as updating or replacing vulnerable components, resolving licensing conflicts,
      or applying security patches.

  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS does not directly relate to implementing a Software
    Composition Analysis (SCA) process. SCA is a process for identifying and analyzing
    open source and third-party components used in an application codebase. The IAM
    Resource manages AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, users, and
    access keys, which are used for controlling access to AWS resources, but do not
    provide functionality for performing SCA.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM Resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    partial: The IAM Resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
    success: The IAM Resource is not applicable for implementing an SCA process.
  reason: The IAM Resource in AWS is not applicable for implementing an SCA process,
    as it does not provide functionality for analyzing the composition of software
    components or identifying potential vulnerabilities and licensing issues within
    an application codebase.
