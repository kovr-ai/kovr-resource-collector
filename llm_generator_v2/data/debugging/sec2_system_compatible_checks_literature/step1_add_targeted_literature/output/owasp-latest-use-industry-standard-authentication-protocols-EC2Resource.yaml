  fix_details:
    automation_available: false
    description: Since the EC2Resource does not contain information about the authentication
      protocols used by applications, this check cannot be directly implemented or
      remediated using this resource alone.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the number of applications and complexity
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the applications running on the EC2 instances that handle user authentication.
    - 2. Review the authentication protocols and mechanisms used by these applications.
    - 3. Ensure that industry-standard protocols like OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML
      are used for authentication.
    - 4. Implement secure credential storage and transmission practices.
    - 5. Regularly update and patch the authentication components to address vulnerabilities.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The OWASP latest use industry standard authentication protocols check
    is focused on validating that the application uses industry-standard authentication
    protocols and mechanisms to authenticate users and protect their credentials.
    This check is primarily applicable to web applications, mobile applications, and
    other software systems that handle user authentication and authorization.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use industry-standard authentication protocols
      and mechanisms to authenticate users and protect their credentials, making it
      vulnerable to various attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses industry-standard authentication protocols and mechanisms
      to authenticate users and protect their credentials.
  reason: The provided resource, AWS EC2Resource, represents Elastic Compute Cloud
    (EC2) instances, networking components, and related resources. It does not contain
    information about the authentication protocols or mechanisms used by applications
    running on these instances. Therefore, this resource is not directly applicable
    for implementing the OWASP latest use industry standard authentication protocols
    check.
