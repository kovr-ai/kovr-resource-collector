  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate to updating and patching
    third-party components used in applications or services. It is primarily used
    for managing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, users, and access
    keys. While IAM policies can be used to control access to AWS services and resources,
    they do not provide information about the specific third-party components used
    or their update status.
