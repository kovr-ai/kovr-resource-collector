    description: This resource is not applicable for implementing protection against
      session hijacking attacks. To address this security check, you should review
      and configure session management settings at the application or service level.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the number of applications and services involved.
    instructions:
    - Identify the applications or services that handle user sessions and authentication.
    - Review the session management mechanisms and configurations in those applications
      or services.
    - Implement appropriate measures to protect against session hijacking, such as
      using secure session management practices, implementing session timeouts, and
      protecting session tokens from being exposed or guessed.
    - Consult the application or service documentation for specific guidance on configuring
      session security.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of users,
    which is primarily used for managing access control and permissions. While groups
    can be used to assign roles and permissions to users, this resource does not directly
    relate to session management or protection against session hijacking attacks.
    Session management and protection mechanisms are typically implemented at the
    application or service level, rather than at the group or user management level.
