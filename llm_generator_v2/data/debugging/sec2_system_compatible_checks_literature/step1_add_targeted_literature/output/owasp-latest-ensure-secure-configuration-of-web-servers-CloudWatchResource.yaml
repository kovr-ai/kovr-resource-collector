  literature: The CloudWatchResource in AWS does not directly relate to the secure
    configuration of web servers. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service
    that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources,
    including web servers like Elastic Load Balancing and EC2 instances running web
    applications. While CloudWatch can be used to monitor the performance and health
    of web servers, it does not directly configure or harden the web server itself.
