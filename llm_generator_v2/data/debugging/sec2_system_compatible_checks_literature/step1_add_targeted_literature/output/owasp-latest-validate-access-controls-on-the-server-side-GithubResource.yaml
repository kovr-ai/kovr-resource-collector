    description: Since the provided resource is not applicable for this security check,
      no specific fix is required. However, to validate server-side access controls,
      you would need to analyze the actual server-side code and configuration of the
      application or service hosted within the GitHub repository.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. This involves ensuring that only authorized users or entities
    can access and perform specific actions on protected resources or data. The check
    helps identify and mitigate risks associated with improper access control implementation,
    such as broken authentication, broken access control, and insecure direct object
    references.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The server-side access controls for the application are not properly
      implemented or validated, posing potential security risks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The server-side access controls for the application are properly implemented
      and validated.
  reason: The provided resource is a GithubResource, which represents a GitHub repository.
    While GitHub repositories may contain server-side code and applications, the resource
    itself does not provide sufficient information to validate access controls on
    the server-side. The resource primarily contains metadata, statistics, and information
    about the repository, its collaborators, and its security features. However, it
    does not expose details about the server-side implementation or access control
    mechanisms used by any applications or services hosted within the repository.
