    description: To address this issue, the organization needs to establish and implement
      secure deployment processes and security controls throughout the deployment
      lifecycle.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - 1. Develop and document secure deployment processes, including requirements
      for code reviews, vulnerability scanning, secure configuration management, and
      access controls.
    - 2. Implement automated tools and processes for code reviews, vulnerability scanning,
      and secure configuration management.
    - 3. Establish access controls and approval processes for deployments, ensuring
      that only authorized personnel can deploy changes.
    - 4. Conduct regular audits and assessments to ensure that the secure deployment
      processes are being followed consistently.
    - 5. Provide training and awareness programs for development, operations, and
      security teams on the secure deployment processes and their responsibilities.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' check focuses
    on ensuring that an organization has implemented secure processes for deploying
    applications and infrastructure components. This includes practices such as code
    reviews, vulnerability scanning, secure configuration management, and access controls
    throughout the deployment lifecycle. The EC2Resource in AWS primarily represents
    information about EC2 instances, networking components, and related resources,
    but does not directly cover the deployment processes and security controls required
    for this check.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure processes for deploying applications
      and infrastructure components, putting systems and data at risk of successful
      cyber attacks.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented secure deployment processes,
      but there are gaps or weaknesses that need to be addressed.
    success: The organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
      and infrastructure components, including code reviews, vulnerability scanning,
      secure configuration management, and access controls throughout the deployment
      lifecycle.
  reason: The EC2Resource does not contain information directly related to the secure
    deployment processes and security controls required for the 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes'
    check. While it provides details about EC2 instances, networking components, and
    related resources, it does not cover the organizational processes and controls
    for secure deployments.
