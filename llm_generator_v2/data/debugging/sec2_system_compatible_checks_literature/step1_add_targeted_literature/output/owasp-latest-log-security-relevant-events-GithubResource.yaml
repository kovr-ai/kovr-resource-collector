  field_paths: []
  fix_details:
    automation_available: true
    description: Since the GitHub resource does not contain any logging or auditing
      capabilities, it cannot be used to implement this security check. To address
      this issue, you would need to identify and configure a separate logging solution
      that can capture security-relevant events.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of your environment and the
      logging solution chosen.
    instructions:
    - Evaluate and select a logging solution that meets your organization's requirements
      for security event logging.
    - Configure the logging solution to capture security-relevant events from your
      systems and applications.
    - Establish processes for monitoring and reviewing the log data for potential
      security incidents.
    - Implement retention policies and procedures for log data to support incident
      response and forensic analysis.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. However, the provided GitHub resource does not appear to
    contain any information related to logging or audit trails.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The system is not logging security-relevant events, which could hinder
      incident response and forensic analysis.
    partial: N/A
    success: The system is properly logging security-relevant events, enabling effective
      incident response and forensic analysis.
  reason: The GitHub resource provided contains information about repositories, collaborators,
    actions, security advisories, and other GitHub-specific data, but does not include
    any logging or auditing capabilities. Therefore, this resource is not applicable
    for implementing the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' security check.
