  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' represents user account information
    in Google Workspace, which does not directly relate to reviewing and updating
    security procedures. This security check focuses on the organizational process
    of regularly assessing and updating security policies, procedures, and controls
    to align with evolving threats and best practices. While user account data may
    be relevant for certain security controls, it does not provide insight into the
    overall security governance and risk management processes of the organization.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization does not have a documented process for regularly reviewing
      and updating security procedures, leaving it vulnerable to emerging threats
      and non-compliance with industry standards.
    partial: The organization partially reviews and updates security procedures, but
      the process is not comprehensive or consistent across all areas.
    success: The organization has a well-defined process for regularly reviewing and
      updating security procedures, aligning with evolving threats and industry best
      practices.
  reason: The UserResource represents user account data, which does not directly relate
    to the organizational process of reviewing and updating security procedures as
    recommended by OWASP. This resource lacks information about the organization's
    security governance, risk assessment, and policy management practices.
