    description: To implement this security check, you need to analyze the configuration
      of the specific database resources in your AWS environment.
    estimated_time: The time required will vary depending on the number of database
      resources and the complexity of their configurations.
    instructions:
    - Identify the database resources (e.g., RDS instances, Aurora clusters) in your
      AWS environment.
    - Review the configuration settings of these database resources, including authentication
      mechanisms, access controls, encryption settings, auditing, and logging.
    - Ensure that the database configurations align with industry best practices and
      security guidelines.
    - Implement any necessary changes to the database configurations to meet the security
      requirements.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The IAMResource in AWS does not directly relate to the configuration
    of databases. It provides information about AWS Identity and Access Management
    (IAM) policies and user access keys, which are used for controlling access to
    AWS resources, including databases. However, it does not contain specific details
    about the configuration settings of databases themselves.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAMResource does not directly relate to database configuration, so
      this check is not applicable.
    partial: The IAMResource does not directly relate to database configuration, so
      this check is not applicable.
    success: The IAMResource does not directly relate to database configuration, so
      this check is not applicable.
  reason: The security check 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-databases'
    focuses on validating the secure configuration of databases, such as authentication
    mechanisms, access controls, encryption settings, auditing, and logging. The IAMResource
    in AWS does not provide information about these specific database configuration
    settings.
