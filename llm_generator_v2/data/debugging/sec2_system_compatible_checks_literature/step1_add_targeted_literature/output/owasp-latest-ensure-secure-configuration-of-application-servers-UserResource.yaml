    description: To address insecure application server configurations, you need to
      review and update the server settings according to industry best practices and
      hardening guidelines.
    estimated_time: The time required can vary depending on the number of application
      servers and the complexity of the configurations, but a typical implementation
      could take several hours to a few days.
    instructions:
    - Identify all application servers in your environment and their current configurations.
    - Compare the configurations against industry-standard hardening guidelines, such
      as those provided by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) or the vendor's
      own hardening guides.
    - Update any insecure settings, such as disabling unnecessary services, restricting
      access, enabling secure protocols, and configuring appropriate logging and monitoring.
    - Implement a process for regularly reviewing and updating application server
      configurations to maintain a secure posture.

  literature: The provided resource 'UserResource' appears to be related to user account
    management in Google Workspace. While secure configuration of user accounts is
    important, this resource does not directly relate to the configuration of application
    servers, which is the focus of the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-application-servers'
    security check. This check is intended to validate the secure configuration of
    web application servers, such as Apache or Nginx, to prevent vulnerabilities like
    remote code execution, data exposure, and privilege escalation.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more application servers have insecure configurations, which could
      lead to vulnerabilities like remote code execution, data exposure, and privilege
      escalation.
    partial: Some application servers have secure configurations, but others have
      insecure settings that need to be addressed.
    success: The application servers are configured securely, following industry best
      practices and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The 'UserResource' is focused on user account details and does not contain
    information about the configuration of application servers, which is the primary
    concern of this security check.
