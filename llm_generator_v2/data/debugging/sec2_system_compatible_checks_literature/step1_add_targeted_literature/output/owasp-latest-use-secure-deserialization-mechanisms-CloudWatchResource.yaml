    description: This security check is not applicable to the AWS CloudWatch resource.
      However, if you are concerned about secure deserialization in your applications,
      you should review your application code and libraries to ensure that deserialization
      mechanisms are properly validated and secured.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the application and the
      number of deserialization mechanisms used.
    instructions:
    - Identify all deserialization mechanisms used in your application code and third-party
      libraries.
    - Review the deserialization mechanisms for potential vulnerabilities, such as
      insecure deserialization of untrusted data.
    - Implement secure deserialization mechanisms, such as whitelisting allowed classes,
      validating input data, and using secure deserialization libraries.
    - Test and validate the secure deserialization mechanisms to ensure they are effective
      in preventing code execution and data tampering attacks.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-deserialization-mechanisms'
    is focused on ensuring that applications use secure deserialization mechanisms
    to prevent code execution and data tampering attacks. However, the provided AWS
    CloudWatch resource does not appear to be directly related to application deserialization
    mechanisms. CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects
    and analyzes metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources and applications.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The application does not use secure deserialization mechanisms, leaving
      it vulnerable to code execution and data tampering attacks.
    partial: N/A
    success: The application uses secure deserialization mechanisms to prevent code
      execution and data tampering attacks.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, and does not directly handle application deserialization mechanisms.
    Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing this specific security check.
