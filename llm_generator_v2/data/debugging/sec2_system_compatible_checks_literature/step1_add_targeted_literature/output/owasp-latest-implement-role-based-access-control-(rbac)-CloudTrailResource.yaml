    description: To implement RBAC in your AWS environment, you should focus on configuring
      the IAM service properly.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Create IAM users, groups, and roles based on your organizational structure
      and access requirements.
    - 2. Define and attach IAM policies to users, groups, and roles, granting them
      the necessary permissions to access specific AWS resources and services.
    - 3. Review and adjust IAM policies regularly to ensure they align with the principle
      of least privilege.
    - 4. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged IAM users and roles.
    - 5. Configure CloudTrail to log relevant events, including IAM-related events,
      for auditing and monitoring purposes.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The CloudTrail resource in AWS is a service that records AWS API calls
    and related events for your account. While it can provide valuable audit trails
    and logging capabilities, it does not directly implement Role-Based Access Control
    (RBAC) for controlling access to resources and services within your AWS environment.
    RBAC is typically implemented through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    service, which allows you to create and manage users, groups, roles, and permissions.
  name: CloudTrailResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudTrail is not configured to log relevant events, and RBAC is not
      implemented through IAM.
    partial: CloudTrail is partially configured to log relevant events, but RBAC implementation
      through IAM is incomplete.
    success: CloudTrail is configured to log relevant events, and RBAC is implemented
      through IAM.
  reason: The CloudTrail resource is primarily used for logging and auditing purposes,
    and does not directly implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionality.
    RBAC is typically implemented through the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    service, which allows you to create and manage users, groups, roles, and permissions.
