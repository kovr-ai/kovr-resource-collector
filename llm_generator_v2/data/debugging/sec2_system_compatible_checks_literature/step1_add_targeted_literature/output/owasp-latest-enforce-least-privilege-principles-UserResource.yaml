    description: If the check fails or partially passes, it indicates that user accounts
      have been granted excessive permissions or access rights beyond their authorized
      tasks. This can be remediated by reviewing and adjusting user roles, permissions,
      and access controls within the Google Workspace Admin console.
    estimated_time: 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the number of user accounts
      and complexity of the environment.
    instructions:
    - Review the roles and responsibilities of each user account.
    - Identify the minimum necessary permissions and access rights required for each
      user's authorized tasks.
    - Within the Google Workspace Admin console, adjust user roles, permissions, and
      access controls to align with the principle of least privilege.
    - Remove any unnecessary or excessive permissions or access rights from user accounts.
    - Implement periodic reviews and audits to ensure continued adherence to the principle
      of least privilege.

  literature: The Google UserResource represents a user account within the Google
    Workspace environment. Enforcing the principle of least privilege for this resource
    involves ensuring that user accounts are granted only the necessary permissions
    and access rights to perform their authorized tasks, and no more. This can be
    achieved by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and granular permission
    management within the Google Workspace Admin console.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The user account has been granted excessive permissions or access rights
      beyond what is required for their role and responsibilities.
    partial: Some user accounts have been granted excessive permissions or access
      rights, while others adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    success: The user account has been granted the minimum necessary permissions and
      access rights based on their role and responsibilities.
  reason: The UserResource contains fields that can be used to manage user privileges,
    roles, and access controls within the Google Workspace environment, making it
    applicable for implementing the principle of least privilege.
