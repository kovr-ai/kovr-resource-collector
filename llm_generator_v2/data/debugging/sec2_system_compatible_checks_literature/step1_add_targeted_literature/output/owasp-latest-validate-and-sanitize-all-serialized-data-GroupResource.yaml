  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to handle any serialized
    data or deserialization operations. This resource represents a group of entities,
    such as users or service accounts, and contains metadata about the group, its
    members, and related information. It does not seem to involve processing or deserializing
    serialized data structures, which is the focus of this security check.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not handle serialized data, so this check is not
      applicable.
    partial: The GroupResource does not handle serialized data, so this check is not
      applicable.
    success: The GroupResource does not handle serialized data, so this check is not
      applicable.
  reason: The GroupResource does not handle serialized data or deserialization operations,
    which is the primary concern of this security check. The resource's fields contain
    metadata about the group and its members, but do not appear to involve processing
    serialized data structures.
