    description: This check is not directly applicable to the AWS S3 resource, as
      it focuses on server-side application code and logic rather than storage services.

  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. This check is primarily focused on ensuring that server-side
    code and logic correctly enforce access controls and authorization mechanisms
    for protected resources and data.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The server-side application code does not properly implement access controls
      and authorization mechanisms, potentially allowing unauthorized access to protected
      resources and data.
    partial: N/A
    success: The server-side application code correctly implements access controls
      and authorization mechanisms for protected resources and data.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not directly implement
    server-side application logic or access controls. While S3 provides access control
    mechanisms through bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs), these are
    not the primary focus of the 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side'
    check, which is more concerned with the server-side application code and logic
    that enforces access controls.
