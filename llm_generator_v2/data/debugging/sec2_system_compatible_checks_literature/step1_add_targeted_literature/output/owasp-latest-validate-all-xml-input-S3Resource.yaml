  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security check is designed
    to validate XML input received by an application to prevent various types of XML-based
    attacks. However, the AWS S3 resource provided is a storage service for storing
    and retrieving data, and it does not directly handle XML input or application
    logic. Therefore, this security check is not directly applicable to the S3 resource.

  output_statements:
    failure: This check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource.
    success: This check is not applicable to the AWS S3 resource.
  reason: The AWS S3 resource is a storage service and does not directly handle XML
    input or application logic. The 'owasp-latest-validate-all-xml-input' security
    check is focused on validating XML input received by an application, which is
    not the primary function of the S3 resource.
