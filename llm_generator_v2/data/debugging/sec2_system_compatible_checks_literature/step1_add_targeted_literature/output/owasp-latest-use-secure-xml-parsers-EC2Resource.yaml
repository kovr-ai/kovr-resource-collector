    description: This security check is not applicable to the EC2 resource.
    estimated_time: N/A
    instructions: []
  is_valid: false
  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers' is related
    to the use of secure XML parsers in applications to prevent vulnerabilities such
    as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML Injection, and Denial of Service (DoS)
    attacks. This check is primarily applicable to application-level resources that
    handle XML data processing and parsing.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The EC2 resource does not handle XML data processing, and therefore,
      this check is not applicable.
    partial: This check is not applicable to the EC2 resource.
    success: The EC2 resource is configured to use secure XML parsers for all XML
      data processing.
  reason: The provided resource 'EC2Resource' is an AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
    resource, which represents virtual machines (instances) and related networking
    components. This resource does not directly handle XML parsing or processing.
    Therefore, it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-xml-parsers'
    security check.
