    description: 'To fully implement secure deployment processes, the organization
      should establish and document a comprehensive deployment lifecycle with appropriate
      security controls, including but not limited to:'
    estimated_time: Varies based on the organization's size and complexity, but typically
      takes several weeks to several months to fully implement.
    instructions:
    - 1. Implement a formal change management process with code reviews, testing,
      and approval gates.
    - 2. Conduct regular vulnerability scanning and remediation for all components.
    - 3. Enforce secure configuration management practices for infrastructure and
      applications.
    - 4. Implement access controls and segregation of duties for deployment activities.
    - 5. Establish monitoring and logging mechanisms for deployment activities.
    - 6. Develop incident response and rollback procedures for failed or compromised
      deployments.
    - 7. Provide security awareness training for personnel involved in deployment
      processes.
  is_valid: false
  literature: The 'owasp-latest-implement-secure-deployment-processes' check validates
    that an organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
    and infrastructure components. This includes ensuring proper security controls
    are in place throughout the deployment lifecycle, such as code reviews, vulnerability
    scanning, secure configuration management, and access controls.
  name: GithubResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The organization has not implemented secure processes for deploying applications
      and infrastructure components, and lacks proper security controls throughout
      the deployment lifecycle.
    partial: The organization has partially implemented secure deployment processes,
      but there are gaps or weaknesses in the security controls throughout the deployment
      lifecycle.
    success: The organization has implemented secure processes for deploying applications
      and infrastructure components, with proper security controls in place throughout
      the deployment lifecycle.
  reason: The GithubResource provided does not contain sufficient information to fully
    assess the implementation of secure deployment processes within an organization.
    While the resource provides details about GitHub Actions workflows, code scanning
    alerts, security advisories, and vulnerability alerts, it lacks information about
    the organization's overall deployment processes, security controls, and governance
    practices.
