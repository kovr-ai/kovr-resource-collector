    description: To implement input validation for XSS prevention, you need to focus
      on the web application code and server configurations.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the complexity of the web application.
    instructions:
    - Review the web application code and identify all user input fields and parameters.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization techniques, such as whitelisting,
      escaping, and encoding, to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Configure the web server to set appropriate security headers, such as X-XSS-Protection
      and Content-Security-Policy.
    - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of trusted
      content and prevent XSS attacks.
    - Regularly update and patch the web application and server components to address
      known vulnerabilities.

  literature: The IAM Resource in AWS is used for managing access to AWS services
    and resources. It does not directly relate to implementing input validation for
    preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which is a web application security
    concern. XSS prevention measures should be implemented within the application
    code and web server configurations.
  name: IAMResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The IAM Resource is not designed to implement input validation for XSS
      prevention.
    partial: The IAM Resource does not directly support input validation for XSS prevention.
    success: The IAM Resource is configured to support input validation for XSS prevention.
  reason: The IAM Resource is not applicable for implementing input validation for
    XSS prevention, as it is a service for managing access control and permissions
    within AWS, rather than a web application resource.
