    description: To protect against brute force attacks, you need to configure appropriate
      security settings at the authentication layer or through specific security services
      offered by Google Cloud.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - Review Google Cloud's documentation on best practices for protecting against
      brute force attacks.
    - Implement recommended measures such as account lockout policies, IP address
      blocking, and CAPTCHA challenges.
    - Consider using Google Cloud's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to
      manage access controls and authentication policies.
    - Utilize Google Cloud's security services, such as Cloud Armor or Cloud Identity-Aware
      Proxy (IAP), to provide additional protection against brute force attacks.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud does not appear to be directly related
    to protecting against brute force attacks. This resource represents a group of
    users or entities within an organization, and its fields primarily contain information
    about the group's metadata, such as its name, description, and membership details.
    While protecting against brute force attacks is an important security measure,
    it is typically implemented at the authentication layer or through specific security
    configurations, rather than being directly tied to a user group resource.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource does not have any configurations to protect against
      brute force attacks.
    partial: The GroupResource partially protects against brute force attacks, but
      additional measures are required.
    success: The GroupResource is configured to protect against brute force attacks.
  reason: The GroupResource in Google Cloud is primarily used for managing user groups
    and their membership information. It does not contain any fields or configurations
    directly related to implementing protection mechanisms against brute force attacks,
    such as account lockout policies, IP address blocking, or CAPTCHA challenges.
