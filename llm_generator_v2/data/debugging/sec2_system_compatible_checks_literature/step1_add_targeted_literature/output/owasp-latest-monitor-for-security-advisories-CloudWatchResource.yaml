    description: To fully implement this security check, you need to integrate CloudWatch
      with a separate service or mechanism that specifically monitors and alerts on
      security advisories from software vendors and security researchers.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours for initial setup, ongoing maintenance required
    instructions:
    - Identify the software vendors and security research organizations relevant to
      your environment.
    - Subscribe to their security advisory mailing lists or RSS feeds.
    - Set up a centralized system or service to collect and process these security
      advisories.
    - Configure CloudWatch to monitor and alert on events or logs generated by this
      centralized system.

  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is primarily used for monitoring and
    logging purposes. It allows you to collect and analyze metrics, logs, and events
    from various AWS resources and applications. While CloudWatch can be useful for
    monitoring security-related events and metrics, it does not directly address the
    specific requirement of monitoring for security advisories from software vendors
    or security researchers.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: CloudWatch is not configured to monitor and alert on security advisories
      from software vendors and security researchers.
    partial: CloudWatch is partially configured to monitor and alert on security advisories,
      but additional configuration or integration with external sources is required.
    success: CloudWatch is configured to monitor and alert on relevant security advisories
      from software vendors and security researchers.
  reason: The CloudWatch resource is primarily focused on monitoring and logging,
    but it does not provide functionality for actively monitoring and receiving security
    advisories from external sources. To implement this security check, you would
    need a separate mechanism or service that specifically tracks and alerts on security
    advisories from software vendors and security researchers.
