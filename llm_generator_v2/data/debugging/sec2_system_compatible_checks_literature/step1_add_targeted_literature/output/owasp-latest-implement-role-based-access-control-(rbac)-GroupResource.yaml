    description: To implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Google Cloud Platform,
      you need to use a combination of resources and services, such as Cloud Identity
      and Access Management (IAM), Cloud Identity, and Cloud Resource Manager.
    estimated_time: 1-2 hours
    instructions:
    - 1. Define roles and permissions in Cloud IAM based on the principle of least
      privilege.
    - 2. Assign roles to users, groups, or service accounts using Cloud IAM policies.
    - 3. Use Cloud Identity to manage user identities and group memberships.
    - 4. Use Cloud Resource Manager to organize and manage resources in a hierarchical
      structure.
    - 5. Review and audit access regularly to ensure compliance with RBAC principles.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a collection of
    entities, such as users or service accounts, that can be granted access to other
    resources. While groups can be used to manage access control, they do not directly
    implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as defined by the security check. RBAC
    requires the assignment of specific roles and permissions to users or groups,
    which is not directly handled by the GroupResource itself.

  output_statements:
    failure: The application or system has not implemented Role-Based Access Control
      (RBAC) effectively, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential
      security incidents.
    partial: The application or system has partially implemented Role-Based Access
      Control (RBAC), but there are areas that need improvement to reduce the risk
      of unauthorized access and potential security incidents.
    success: The application or system has implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
      effectively, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security
      incidents.
  reason: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform is used to manage collections
    of entities, but it does not directly implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    as defined by the security check. RBAC requires the assignment of specific roles
    and permissions, which is handled by other resources and services in Google Cloud
    Platform.
