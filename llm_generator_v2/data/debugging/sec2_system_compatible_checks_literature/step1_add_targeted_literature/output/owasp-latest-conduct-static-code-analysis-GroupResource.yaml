    description: This resource is not applicable for static code analysis. To implement
      this security check, you need to identify and analyze the relevant source code
      or application resources in your Google Cloud environment.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the size and complexity of the codebase or
      application resources.
    instructions:
    - Identify the source code repositories or application resources that need to
      be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities and coding issues.
    - Configure the OWASP static code analysis tool to scan the identified code repositories
      or application resources.
    - Schedule regular scans and review the analysis results to identify and remediate
      any issues found.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of entities,
    such as users or service accounts, and is primarily used for access control and
    identity management purposes. It does not contain any source code or application-level
    information that would be relevant for conducting static code analysis.
  name: GroupResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The GroupResource is not a code artifact or application resource, and
      therefore cannot be analyzed using the OWASP static code analysis tool.
    partial: The GroupResource is not a code artifact or application resource, and
      therefore cannot be analyzed using the OWASP static code analysis tool.
    success: The GroupResource has been successfully analyzed for potential vulnerabilities
      and coding issues using the latest OWASP static code analysis tool.
  reason: The GroupResource is not a code artifact or application resource, and therefore
    is not applicable for implementing the OWASP static code analysis security check.
    This check is designed to analyze source code for potential vulnerabilities and
    coding issues, which is not the purpose or function of the GroupResource.
