    description: This resource is not suitable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-conduct-penetration-testing'
      security check. To conduct penetration testing and assess the security posture
      of your Google Cloud environment, you should consider using other tools and
      services specifically designed for security testing and vulnerability assessment.
    estimated_time: Varies depending on the size and complexity of your cloud environment.
    instructions:
    - Explore Google Cloud's security services, such as Cloud Security Command Center,
      Web Risk API, and Security Health Analytics, which can help identify vulnerabilities
      and assess your security posture.
    - Consider using third-party penetration testing tools or services that can simulate
      real-world attack scenarios and identify potential vulnerabilities in your cloud
      environment.
    - Implement a comprehensive security testing and assessment strategy that includes
      regular penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security audits.

  literature: The GroupResource in Google Cloud Platform represents a group of users,
    which is primarily used for managing access control and permissions. While groups
    can be used to organize users for security purposes, this resource itself does
    not directly relate to conducting penetration testing or assessing an organization's
    security posture through simulated attacks.

    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-conduct-penetration-testing'
      security check.
  reason: The GroupResource is not directly applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-conduct-penetration-testing'
    security check, as it does not provide functionality for simulating cyber attacks
    or identifying vulnerabilities through penetration testing. This resource is primarily
    used for user and access management, rather than security testing and assessment.
