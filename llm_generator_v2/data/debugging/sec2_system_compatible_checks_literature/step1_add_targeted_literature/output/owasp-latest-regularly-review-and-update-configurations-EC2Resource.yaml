    description: To address this issue, you need to establish and document a formal
      process for regularly reviewing and updating system configurations for EC2 resources,
      including instances, networking components, and other related resources.
    estimated_time: 2-4 weeks
    instructions:
    - 1. Develop a comprehensive configuration management plan that outlines the scope,
      frequency, and procedures for reviewing and updating system configurations.
    - 2. Implement a centralized configuration management system or tool to manage
      and track configuration changes across all EC2 resources.
    - 3. Define roles and responsibilities for configuration management activities,
      including review, approval, and deployment processes.
    - 4. Establish a change management process to ensure that configuration changes
      are properly documented, tested, and approved before deployment.
    - 5. Regularly review and update system configurations based on the defined schedule,
      taking into account new vulnerabilities, security patches, and best practices.
    - 6. Maintain detailed documentation and audit trails for all configuration changes
      and reviews.

  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    is designed to ensure that system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated
    to maintain a secure posture. However, the provided AWS EC2Resource does not contain
    any information about configuration management processes or review procedures.
    This resource primarily contains details about EC2 instances, networking components,
    and other infrastructure resources, but lacks information about how configurations
    are managed and updated.
  name: EC2Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: The AWS account does not have a defined process for regularly reviewing
      and updating system configurations for EC2 resources.
    partial: The AWS account has a process for reviewing and updating some system
      configurations for EC2 resources, but it is not comprehensive or consistently
      applied.
    success: The AWS account has a well-defined process for regularly reviewing and
      updating system configurations across all EC2 resources.
  reason: The AWS EC2Resource does not contain any relevant information or fields
    related to configuration management processes, review procedures, or update mechanisms.
    This resource is focused on providing details about the EC2 infrastructure components
    themselves, rather than the processes for managing their configurations.
