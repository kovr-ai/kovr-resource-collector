    description: To implement the 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
      security check, you should focus on resources that directly manage system configurations,
      such as AWS Config, AWS Systems Manager, or AWS CloudFormation. These services
      provide mechanisms for defining, deploying, and updating configurations across
      various AWS resources and services.
    estimated_time: 1-2 weeks
    instructions:
    - 1. Identify the AWS resources and services that require regular configuration
      reviews and updates.
    - 2. Implement a configuration management process using services like AWS Config,
      AWS Systems Manager, or AWS CloudFormation.
    - 3. Define and maintain configuration baselines and desired state definitions.
    - 4. Establish a regular review and update schedule for configurations.
    - 5. Automate the deployment of configuration updates using tools like AWS CodePipeline
      or AWS Lambda functions.
    - 6. Monitor and audit configuration changes using AWS Config Rules or CloudTrail
      logs.

  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    is designed to ensure that system configurations are regularly reviewed and updated
    to maintain a secure posture. However, the AWS CloudWatch resource provided does
    not directly relate to system configurations or their review and update processes.
    CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects and analyzes
    metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources and applications. While CloudWatch
    can be used to monitor and alert on configuration changes, it does not directly
    manage or update configurations itself.
  name: CloudWatchResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The CloudWatch resource does not have the capability to regularly review
      and update system configurations.
    partial: The CloudWatch resource can monitor configuration changes, but cannot
      directly update configurations.
    success: The CloudWatch resource is configured to regularly review and update
      system configurations.
  reason: The AWS CloudWatch resource is primarily used for monitoring and observability
    purposes, and does not directly manage or update system configurations. Therefore,
    it is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-configurations'
    security check.
