  literature: The CloudWatch resource in AWS is a monitoring and observability service
    that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from various AWS resources
    and applications. It does not directly handle user input or output rendering,
    which is the primary focus of the 'owasp-latest-implement-output-encoding-for-xss-prevention'
    security check. This check is specifically designed to ensure that web applications
    properly encode and sanitize user input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    vulnerabilities.
