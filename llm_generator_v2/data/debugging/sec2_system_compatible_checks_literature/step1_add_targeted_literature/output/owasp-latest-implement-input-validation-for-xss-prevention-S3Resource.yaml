  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-for-xss-prevention'
    is focused on preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications
    by implementing input validation. This involves sanitizing and validating user
    input to ensure that it does not contain any malicious code or scripts before
    rendering it on the web page. However, the provided resource 'S3Resource' is an
    AWS S3 bucket, which is an object storage service and not a web application. S3
    buckets are used for storing and retrieving data, and do not directly handle user
    input or render web pages.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-for-xss-prevention'
      security check.
    partial: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-for-xss-prevention'
      security check.
    success: This resource is not applicable for the 'owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-for-xss-prevention'
      security check.
  reason: The S3Resource is not a web application and does not handle user input or
    render web pages, which is the primary focus of the 'owasp-latest-implement-input-validation-for-xss-prevention'
    security check. Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing this
    specific security check.
