  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-application-servers'
    is focused on ensuring secure configuration of application servers, which are
    critical components of web applications responsible for handling requests, executing
    business logic, and serving content. This check aims to validate that application
    servers are configured securely, following industry best practices and hardening
    guidelines to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
  name: S3Resource
  output_statements:
    failure: One or more application servers are not configured securely, posing a
      risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security incidents.
    partial: Some application servers are configured securely, but others require
      further hardening.
    success: The application servers are configured securely, following industry best
      practices and hardening guidelines.
  reason: The provided resource 'S3Resource' is an AWS S3 bucket, which is an object
    storage service used for storing and retrieving data. S3 buckets are not application
    servers and do not handle requests, execute business logic, or serve content directly.
    Therefore, this resource is not applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-ensure-secure-configuration-of-application-servers'
    security check.
