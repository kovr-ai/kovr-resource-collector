      XML processing, there are no specific fixes required for this security check.

  literature: The security check 'owasp-latest-disable-xml-external-entity-processing'
    is focused on preventing XML External Entity (XXE) attacks by disabling external
    entity processing in applications that parse XML input. This check is typically
    applicable to web applications, APIs, or services that handle XML data. The provided
    resource 'UserResource' appears to be a user management resource in Google Cloud,
    which is unlikely to be directly related to XML parsing or processing.
  name: UserResource
  output_statements:
    failure: The UserResource has been found to have external entity processing enabled
      for XML handling components, which could lead to potential XXE vulnerabilities.
    partial: N/A
    success: The UserResource has been confirmed to have external entity processing
      disabled for any XML handling components.
  reason: The UserResource does not seem to be an application or service that handles
    XML input or processing. As a user management resource, it is unlikely to be directly
    relevant for implementing this specific security check related to disabling XML
    external entity processing.
