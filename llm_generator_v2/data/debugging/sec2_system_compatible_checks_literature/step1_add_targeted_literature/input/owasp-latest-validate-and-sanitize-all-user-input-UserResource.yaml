  literature: User input validation and sanitization is a critical security measure
    that helps prevent various types of attacks, such as injection attacks (e.g.,
    SQL injection, command injection, code injection), cross-site scripting (XSS),
    and other types of input-related vulnerabilities. Failing to properly validate
    and sanitize user input can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system
    compromise. This check ensures that all user input is thoroughly validated and
    sanitized before being processed or stored, reducing the risk of injection attacks
    and other input-related vulnerabilities.
