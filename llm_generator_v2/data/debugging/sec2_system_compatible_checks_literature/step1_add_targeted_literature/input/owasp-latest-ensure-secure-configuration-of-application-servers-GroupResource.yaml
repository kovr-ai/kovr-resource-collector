  literature: Application servers are a critical component of modern web applications,
    handling requests, executing business logic, and serving content. Ensuring secure
    configuration of these servers is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, data
    breaches, and other security incidents. This check validates that application
    servers are configured securely, following industry best practices and hardening
    guidelines. Insecure configurations can lead to vulnerabilities such as unintended
    data exposure, remote code execution, and privilege escalation, which can be exploited
    by attackers to compromise the entire application and underlying infrastructure.
