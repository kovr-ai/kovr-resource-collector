  literature: Comprehensive monitoring mechanisms are essential for detecting and
    responding to security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and potential
    data breaches. This check validates that an organization has implemented robust
    monitoring systems that can track and log various activities across its infrastructure,
    applications, and user interactions. Effective monitoring enables organizations
    to identify anomalies, suspicious behavior, and potential threats in a timely
    manner, allowing for prompt investigation and mitigation. Without comprehensive
    monitoring, organizations may remain unaware of security incidents, leaving them
    vulnerable to data breaches, system compromises, and regulatory non-compliance.
