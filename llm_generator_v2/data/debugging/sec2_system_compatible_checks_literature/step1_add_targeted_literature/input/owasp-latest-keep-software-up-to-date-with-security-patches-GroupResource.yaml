  literature: Keeping software up-to-date with the latest security patches is a critical
    security practice that helps mitigate the risk of known vulnerabilities being
    exploited by attackers. Software vendors regularly release updates and patches
    to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other issues.
    Failing to apply these patches leaves systems and applications vulnerable to potential
    attacks, data breaches, and other security incidents. This check validates that
    software and systems are regularly updated with the latest security patches to
    ensure that known vulnerabilities are addressed and the overall security posture
    is maintained.
