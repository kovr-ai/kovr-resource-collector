  literature: XML parsers are used to process and manipulate XML data. Insecure XML
    parsers can be vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as XML External Entity
    (XXE) attacks, XML Injection, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. These vulnerabilities
    can lead to sensitive data exposure, unauthorized access, or system crashes. Using
    secure XML parsers that are properly configured and validated can mitigate these
    risks and ensure the safe handling of XML data.
