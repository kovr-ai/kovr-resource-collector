  literature: Password strength requirements are a critical security control that
    helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to systems and data. Weak passwords
    are susceptible to brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and other password
    cracking techniques, which can lead to compromised accounts and data breaches.
    Implementing strong password requirements, such as minimum length, complexity
    rules, and regular password changes, significantly increases the effort required
    for an attacker to guess or crack a password. This check validates that the latest
    OWASP password strength recommendations are implemented, ensuring that passwords
    meet industry-standard security requirements.
