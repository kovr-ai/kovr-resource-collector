  literature: Brute force attacks are a common technique used by attackers to gain
    unauthorized access to systems or accounts by systematically trying all possible
    combinations of credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) until the correct
    one is found. This check validates that appropriate measures are in place to protect
    against such attacks, which can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and
    other security incidents. Implementing protection mechanisms like account lockouts,
    IP address blocking, and CAPTCHA challenges can significantly reduce the risk
    of successful brute force attacks.
