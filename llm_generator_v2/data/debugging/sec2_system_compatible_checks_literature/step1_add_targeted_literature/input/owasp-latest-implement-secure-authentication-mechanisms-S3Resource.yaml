  literature: The OWASP latest secure authentication mechanisms check validates that
    the application implements secure authentication mechanisms to protect against
    common authentication attacks such as brute-force, credential stuffing, and session
    hijacking. Proper authentication is crucial for ensuring that only authorized
    users can access sensitive data and functionality within the application. Implementing
    secure authentication mechanisms helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access,
    data breaches, and other security incidents.
