  literature: Databases often store sensitive information that must be protected from
    unauthorized access or modification. Ensuring secure configuration of databases
    is crucial to prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential system
    compromises. This check validates that databases are configured securely, following
    industry best practices and security guidelines. It examines various aspects of
    database configuration, such as authentication mechanisms, access controls, encryption
    settings, auditing, and logging. Proper database configuration helps mitigate
    risks associated with data exposure, unauthorized access, and potential data tampering.
