  literature: The OWASP latest use industry standard authentication protocols check
    validates that the application uses industry-standard authentication protocols
    and mechanisms to authenticate users and protect their credentials. This is important
    because using weak or outdated authentication protocols can make the application
    vulnerable to various attacks, such as brute-force attacks, credential stuffing,
    and man-in-the-middle attacks. By using industry-standard authentication protocols
    like OAuth, OpenID Connect, or SAML, the application can ensure that user credentials
    are securely transmitted and stored, and that only authorized users can access
    the application's resources.
