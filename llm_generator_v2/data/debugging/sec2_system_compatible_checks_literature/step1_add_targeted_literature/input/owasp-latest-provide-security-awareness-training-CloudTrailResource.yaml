  literature: Security awareness training is crucial for organizations to educate
    their employees on identifying and mitigating potential security threats. It helps
    employees understand the importance of cybersecurity, recognize common attack
    vectors, and learn best practices for protecting sensitive information and systems.
    Regular security awareness training can significantly reduce the risk of human
    error, which is often a leading cause of data breaches and cyber incidents. By
    providing employees with the knowledge and skills to identify and respond to security
    threats, organizations can strengthen their overall security posture and better
    protect their assets and reputation.
