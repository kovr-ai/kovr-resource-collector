  literature: Secure logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining an audit trail,
    detecting security incidents, and troubleshooting issues in applications and systems.
    Proper logging practices involve capturing relevant information about user activities,
    system events, and security-related occurrences, while ensuring the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of log data. Implementing secure logging mechanisms
    helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements, forensic investigations,
    and incident response efforts. Failure to implement secure logging can lead to
    data breaches, unauthorized access, and an inability to reconstruct events or
    identify the root cause of security incidents.
