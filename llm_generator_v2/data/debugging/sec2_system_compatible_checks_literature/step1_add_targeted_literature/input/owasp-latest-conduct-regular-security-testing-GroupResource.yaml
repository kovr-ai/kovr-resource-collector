  literature: Regular security testing is a crucial practice in cybersecurity to identify
    vulnerabilities, assess the effectiveness of security controls, and ensure the
    overall security posture of an organization. This check validates whether an organization
    conducts regular security testing, such as penetration testing, vulnerability
    assessments, and code reviews, to proactively identify and mitigate potential
    security risks. Failure to perform regular security testing can leave an organization
    vulnerable to cyber threats, data breaches, and compliance violations.
