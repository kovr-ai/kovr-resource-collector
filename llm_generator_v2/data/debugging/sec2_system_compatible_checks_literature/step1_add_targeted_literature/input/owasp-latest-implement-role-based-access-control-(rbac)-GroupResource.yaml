  literature: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security principle that restricts
    system access to authorized users based on their assigned roles and permissions.
    It is a fundamental security measure that helps prevent unauthorized access, data
    breaches, and misuse of system resources. By implementing RBAC, organizations
    can ensure that users only have access to the information and functionality they
    need to perform their job duties, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    This check validates that the application or system has implemented RBAC effectively,
    reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security incidents.
