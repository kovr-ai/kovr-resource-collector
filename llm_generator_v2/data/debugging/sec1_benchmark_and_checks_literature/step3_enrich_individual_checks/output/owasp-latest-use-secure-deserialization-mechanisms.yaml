check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Insecure deserialization can lead to command and script execution, which
      is covered by this technique.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1059
  - confidence: 0.95
    reason: This sub-technique specifically covers deserialization of untrusted data,
      which can lead to code execution.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1059.007
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement mechanisms to prevent
      unauthorized code execution, which includes secure deserialization mechanisms.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SI-10
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement controls to prevent the
      execution of malicious code, which includes secure deserialization mechanisms.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.12.2.1
  literature: Secure deserialization mechanisms are essential to prevent code execution
    and data tampering attacks. Deserialization is the process of converting serialized
    data into an object, which can be exploited if not properly validated. Insecure
    deserialization can lead to remote code execution, injection attacks, and data
    tampering. This check validates that applications use secure deserialization mechanisms
    to prevent such attacks.
