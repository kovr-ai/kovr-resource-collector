check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Regular security testing can help identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities
      that could be exploited by adversaries to gain initial access or escalate privileges.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1588
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Security testing can help detect and remediate vulnerabilities that could
      be exploited by adversaries to exfiltrate data from the organization.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1499
  category: risk_assessment
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to assess the security controls in
      information systems and organizations on an ongoing basis to determine the extent
      to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
      producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting established security requirements.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CA-2
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to scan for vulnerabilities in the
      information system and hosted applications periodically and when new vulnerabilities
      potentially affecting the system/applications are identified.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-RA-5
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to perform regular testing and monitoring
      of the effectiveness of information security measures implemented.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.14.2.8
  literature: Regular security testing is a crucial practice in cybersecurity to identify
    vulnerabilities, assess the effectiveness of security controls, and ensure the
    overall security posture of an organization. This check validates whether an organization
    conducts regular security testing, such as penetration testing, vulnerability
    assessments, and code reviews, to proactively identify and mitigate potential
    security risks. Failure to perform regular security testing can leave an organization
    vulnerable to cyber threats, data breaches, and compliance violations.
