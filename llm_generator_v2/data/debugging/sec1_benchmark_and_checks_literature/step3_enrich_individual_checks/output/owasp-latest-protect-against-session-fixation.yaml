  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Session fixation can be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access
      to a valid user account, which is related to the Valid Accounts technique.

    reason: Session fixation can potentially be used to gain unauthorized access to
      data stored in cloud storage objects, which is related to the Data from Cloud
      Storage Object technique.

  category: authentication
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires the enforcement of access restrictions for sessions,
      which includes protecting against session fixation attacks.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-AC-3
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires the implementation of access control policies and
      procedures to restrict access to information, which includes protecting against
      session fixation attacks.

  literature: Session fixation is a type of attack that occurs when an attacker is
    able to force a legitimate user to use a session ID known to the attacker. This
    can allow the attacker to hijack the user's session and gain unauthorized access
    to the user's data or perform actions on their behalf. Protecting against session
    fixation is important to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the integrity
    and confidentiality of user sessions and data.
