  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: Following security hardening guidelines can help mitigate the risk of
      exploitation of vulnerabilities, which is a common technique used by adversaries.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: Security hardening guidelines often include recommendations for secure
      configurations, which can help prevent adversaries from exploiting misconfigurations.

  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and monitor configuration
      settings for information systems, which aligns with following security hardening
      guidelines.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-CM-6
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement procedures to control
      the installation of software on operational systems, which aligns with following
      security hardening guidelines.

  literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide a comprehensive set
    of best practices for securing web applications and systems. Following these guidelines
    helps mitigate various security risks, such as unauthorized access, data breaches,
    and system compromises. This check validates whether the latest version of the
    OWASP security hardening guidelines is being followed, ensuring that the system
    is protected against known vulnerabilities and threats.
