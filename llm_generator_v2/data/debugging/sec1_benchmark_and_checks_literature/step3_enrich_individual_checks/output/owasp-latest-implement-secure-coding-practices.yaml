check:
  benchmarks:
  - confidence: 0.7
    reason: Implementing secure coding practices can help prevent exploitation of
      software vulnerabilities, which is a common technique used by adversaries to
      gain initial access or escalate privileges.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1190
  - confidence: 0.6
    reason: Secure coding practices can help prevent vulnerabilities that could lead
      to endpoint denial of service, which is a technique used by adversaries to disrupt
      availability of systems or services.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1499
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement security engineering
      principles in the design, acquisition, development, and maintenance of information
      systems, which includes secure coding practices.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SA-8
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to establish and implement secure
      development policies and procedures, which should include secure coding practices.
    unique_id: ISO-27001-A.14.2.1
  literature: Implementing secure coding practices is a crucial aspect of software
    development that helps mitigate various security risks and vulnerabilities. This
    check validates whether an organization has adopted and enforced secure coding
    practices throughout its software development lifecycle. Secure coding practices
    involve following industry-standard guidelines, using secure coding techniques,
    and implementing security controls to prevent common coding vulnerabilities such
    as injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and more.
    By adhering to secure coding practices, organizations can reduce the attack surface,
    enhance the overall security posture of their applications, and protect sensitive
    data from potential breaches.
