    reason: Disabling XML external entity processing mitigates the risk of XXE attacks,
      which are categorized as a type of 'XML Injection' technique in the MITRE ATT&CK
      framework.
    unique_id: MITRE-ATT&CK-T1608
  category: system_integrity
  controls:
  - confidence: 0.9
    reason: This control requires organizations to implement configuration management
      processes to prevent unauthorized changes to information systems, which includes
      disabling unnecessary features like XML external entity processing.
    unique_id: NIST-800-53-SI-10
  - confidence: 0.8
    reason: This control requires organizations to manage technical vulnerabilities,
      which includes disabling features like XML external entity processing that can
      be exploited by attackers.

  literature: The XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a type of vulnerability that
    can occur when an application parses XML input in an insecure manner, allowing
    an attacker to interfere with the application's processing of XML data. By exploiting
    XXE vulnerabilities, an attacker can potentially read sensitive data, execute
    remote requests, or cause a denial of service condition. Disabling external entity
    processing is a critical security measure to prevent XXE attacks, as it prevents
    the application from resolving external references and entities, effectively mitigating
    the risk of XXE exploitation.
