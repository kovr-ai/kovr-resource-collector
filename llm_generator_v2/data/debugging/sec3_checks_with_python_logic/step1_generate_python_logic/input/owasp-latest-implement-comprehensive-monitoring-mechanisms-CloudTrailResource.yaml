  literature: Comprehensive monitoring mechanisms are essential for detecting and
    responding to security incidents, unauthorized access attempts, and potential
    data breaches. This check validates that an organization has implemented robust
    monitoring systems that can track and log various activities across its infrastructure,
    applications, and user interactions. Effective monitoring enables organizations
    to identify anomalies, suspicious behavior, and potential threats in a timely
    manner, allowing for prompt investigation and mitigation. Without comprehensive
    monitoring, organizations may remain unaware of security incidents, leaving them
    vulnerable to data breaches, system compromises, and regulatory non-compliance.

    literature: The AWS CloudTrail resource is a key component for implementing comprehensive
      monitoring mechanisms as recommended by the OWASP security check. CloudTrail
      captures API activity across AWS services and resources, providing a detailed
      audit trail of user actions, resource changes, and security events. By configuring
      CloudTrail trails with appropriate event selectors and log file validation,
      organizations can monitor and log critical activities, enabling detection of
      unauthorized access attempts, data breaches, and potential security incidents.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource provides comprehensive logging and monitoring
      capabilities for AWS API activities, which aligns with the OWASP security check's
      recommendation for implementing robust monitoring mechanisms to detect security
      incidents and unauthorized access attempts.
