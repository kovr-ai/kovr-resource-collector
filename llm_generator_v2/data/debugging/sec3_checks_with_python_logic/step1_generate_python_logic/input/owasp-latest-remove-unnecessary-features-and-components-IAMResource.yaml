  literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'
    aims to ensure that applications and systems do not expose unnecessary features,
    components, or functionality that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
    Unnecessary features and components can introduce security vulnerabilities, increase
    the attack surface, and provide entry points for malicious actors. By removing
    or disabling these unnecessary elements, the overall security posture of the application
    or system is improved, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches,
    or other security incidents.

    literature: The OWASP check 'owasp-latest-remove-unnecessary-features-and-components'
      is applicable to AWS IAM resources. IAM policies define permissions and access
      levels for AWS resources and services. Unnecessary or overly permissive policies
      can grant excessive privileges, increasing the attack surface and potential
      for unauthorized access or misuse. By reviewing and removing unnecessary policies
      or policy statements, the overall security posture of the AWS account can be
      improved.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource contains policies and policy statements that define permissions
      and access levels. By analyzing these policies and statements, unnecessary or
      overly permissive access can be identified and removed, aligning with the OWASP
      check's goal of reducing the attack surface by removing unnecessary features
      and components.
