  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. Access controls are essential security mechanisms that ensure
    only authorized users or entities can access and perform specific actions on protected
    resources or data. Failing to implement proper access controls on the server-side
    can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security vulnerabilities.
    This check helps identify and mitigate risks associated with improper access control
    implementation, such as broken authentication, broken access control, and insecure
    direct object references.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
      is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the
      server-side of an application. AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS
      API calls and related events, which can be used to monitor and audit access
      to AWS resources. By configuring CloudTrail trails and event selectors, you
      can capture and analyze API activity to ensure that access controls are properly
      enforced and that only authorized entities can perform specific actions on protected
      resources.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource is applicable for implementing the 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side'
      check because it allows you to capture and analyze API activity, including access
      control-related events, across AWS resources. By configuring CloudTrail trails
      and event selectors, you can monitor and audit access to ensure that access
      controls are properly enforced.
