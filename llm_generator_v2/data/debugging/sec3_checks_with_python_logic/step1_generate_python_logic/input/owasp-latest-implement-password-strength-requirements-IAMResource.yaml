  literature: Password strength requirements are a critical security control that
    helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to systems and data. Weak passwords
    are susceptible to brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and other password
    cracking techniques, which can lead to compromised accounts and data breaches.
    Implementing strong password requirements, such as minimum length, complexity
    rules, and regular password changes, significantly increases the effort required
    for an attacker to guess or crack a password. This check validates that the latest
    OWASP password strength recommendations are implemented, ensuring that passwords
    meet industry-standard security requirements.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing the OWASP password
      strength requirements security check. This resource contains information about
      IAM users and their access keys, which can be used to enforce password policies
      and complexity requirements. By analyzing the policies associated with IAM users
      and the access key metadata, you can validate if the latest OWASP password strength
      recommendations are being followed.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource provides access to IAM user details, access keys, and
      associated policies, which are essential for implementing and validating password
      strength requirements as per OWASP recommendations.
