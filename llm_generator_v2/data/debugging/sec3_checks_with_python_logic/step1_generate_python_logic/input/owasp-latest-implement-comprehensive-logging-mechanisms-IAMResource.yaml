  literature: Comprehensive logging mechanisms are essential for maintaining visibility
    into system activities, detecting potential security incidents, and enabling effective
    incident response and forensic analysis. Logging captures detailed information
    about user actions, system events, and security-related activities, providing
    a trail of evidence that can be used to investigate and respond to security breaches,
    policy violations, or operational issues. Implementing comprehensive logging mechanisms
    helps organizations meet compliance requirements, identify and mitigate risks,
    and maintain accountability. Without proper logging, it becomes challenging to
    detect and respond to security incidents, leaving systems vulnerable to various
    threats.

    literature: The IAMResource in AWS is applicable for implementing comprehensive
      logging mechanisms as it contains information about IAM policies, user access
      keys, and MFA devices. Logging changes to IAM policies, access key usage, and
      MFA device assignments can provide visibility into privileged activities and
      potential security risks. This aligns with the OWASP recommendation for maintaining
      audit trails of system events and user actions.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAMResource contains details about IAM policies, user access keys,
      and MFA devices, which are critical components for auditing and logging privileged
      access and changes to security controls. Monitoring these elements can help
      detect and respond to potential security incidents.
