  literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
    is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the server-side
    of an application. Access controls are essential security mechanisms that ensure
    only authorized users or entities can access and perform specific actions on protected
    resources or data. Failing to implement proper access controls on the server-side
    can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security vulnerabilities.
    This check helps identify and mitigate risks associated with improper access control
    implementation, such as broken authentication, broken access control, and insecure
    direct object references.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-validate-access-controls-on-the-server-side' check
      is designed to validate that access controls are properly implemented on the
      server-side for the Google UserResource. This resource contains information
      about a user's account, including administrative privileges, contact details,
      and security settings. Proper access controls are crucial to ensure that only
      authorized users or entities can access and modify sensitive user data.
    name: UserResource
    reason: The UserResource contains fields related to user privileges, identities,
      and security settings, which are essential for implementing proper access controls
      on the server-side. By validating these fields, the security check can ensure
      that only authorized users can access and modify user data based on their assigned
      roles and permissions.
