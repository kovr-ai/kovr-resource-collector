  literature: The 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check validates that applications
    and systems are configured with secure default settings and configurations. Many
    software products and services come with default configurations that prioritize
    ease of use and functionality over security. These default settings often have
    known vulnerabilities, weak security controls, or unnecessary services enabled,
    which can expose the system to various security risks. By enforcing secure defaults,
    this check helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    other security incidents caused by insecure configurations.

    literature: The CloudTrail resource in AWS is applicable for implementing the
      'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' security check. CloudTrail is a service that
      records AWS API calls and related events, providing a log of account activity.
      By configuring CloudTrail with secure defaults, organizations can ensure that
      all relevant events are captured, logged, and monitored for potential security
      incidents or unauthorized activities. This helps maintain system integrity and
      supports compliance with security standards like NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrail resource provides various configuration options that align
      with the 'owasp-latest-use-secure-defaults' check. By enabling log file validation,
      configuring event selectors, including management events, and setting up secure
      S3 bucket and prefix settings, organizations can ensure that CloudTrail captures
      and logs all relevant API activities, supporting system integrity and secure
      defaults.
