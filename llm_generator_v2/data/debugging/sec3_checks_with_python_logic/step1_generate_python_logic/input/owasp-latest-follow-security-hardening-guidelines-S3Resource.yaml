  literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide a comprehensive set
    of best practices for securing web applications and systems. Following these guidelines
    helps mitigate various security risks, such as unauthorized access, data breaches,
    and system compromises. This check validates whether the latest version of the
    OWASP security hardening guidelines is being followed, ensuring that the system
    is protected against known vulnerabilities and threats.

    literature: The OWASP security hardening guidelines provide recommendations for
      securing S3 buckets, such as enabling encryption, disabling public access, and
      configuring access controls. Implementing these guidelines on S3 buckets can
      help mitigate risks like data breaches, unauthorized access, and data tampering.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: S3 buckets store data and can be configured with various security controls.
      Implementing OWASP hardening guidelines on S3 buckets helps secure the data
      stored in them.
