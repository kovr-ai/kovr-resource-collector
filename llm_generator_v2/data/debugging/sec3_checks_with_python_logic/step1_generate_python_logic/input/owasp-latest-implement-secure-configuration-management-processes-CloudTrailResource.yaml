  literature: Secure configuration management processes are essential for maintaining
    the integrity and security of systems and applications. This check validates that
    organizations have implemented robust processes for managing configuration changes,
    including tracking, testing, approving, and deploying changes in a controlled
    manner. Failure to implement secure configuration management processes can lead
    to unauthorized or unintended changes, which can introduce vulnerabilities, system
    instability, and compliance issues. Secure configuration management processes
    help ensure that changes are properly reviewed, tested, and approved before deployment,
    reducing the risk of security incidents and system outages.

    literature: AWS CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events, providing a comprehensive audit trail of account activity. By enabling
      CloudTrail and configuring it correctly, organizations can implement secure
      configuration management processes by tracking and monitoring changes made to
      their AWS resources. CloudTrail logs can be analyzed to identify unauthorized
      or unintended changes, and the logs can be used as evidence for compliance audits
      and investigations.
