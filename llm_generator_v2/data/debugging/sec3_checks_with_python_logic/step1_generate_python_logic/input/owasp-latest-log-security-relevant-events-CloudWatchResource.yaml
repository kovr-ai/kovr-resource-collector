  literature: The 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' check is designed to
    validate that the system is properly logging security-relevant events, which is
    crucial for maintaining an audit trail and enabling effective incident response
    and forensic analysis. Logging security-relevant events helps detect and investigate
    potential security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and other malicious
    activities. It provides a record of system activities, user actions, and security-related
    incidents, enabling organizations to monitor and analyze system behavior, identify
    potential threats, and take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.

    literature: The CloudWatch service in AWS can be used to implement the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events'
      security check. CloudWatch allows you to collect and monitor logs from various
      AWS resources and services, including security-related events. By configuring
      CloudWatch Log Groups and Metric Filters, you can capture and analyze log data
      to detect and investigate potential security incidents, unauthorized access
      attempts, and other security-relevant events.
    name: CloudWatchResource
    reason: The CloudWatch resource in AWS provides logging and monitoring capabilities
      that can be used to capture and analyze security-relevant events, which aligns
      with the 'owasp-latest-log-security-relevant-events' security check.
