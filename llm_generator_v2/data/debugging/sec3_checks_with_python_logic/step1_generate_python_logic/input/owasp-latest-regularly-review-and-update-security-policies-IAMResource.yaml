  literature: Security policies are essential guidelines that outline an organization's
    approach to protecting its information assets and maintaining a secure computing
    environment. These policies define rules, procedures, and best practices for various
    security domains, such as access control, data protection, incident response,
    and risk management. Regular review and updates of security policies are crucial
    to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness in addressing evolving threats,
    technological advancements, and changing business requirements. Outdated or inadequate
    security policies can leave organizations vulnerable to cyber attacks, data breaches,
    and regulatory non-compliance. By regularly reviewing and updating security policies,
    organizations can identify and address gaps, incorporate new security controls,
    and align their policies with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

    literature: The IAM (Identity and Access Management) resource in AWS is relevant
      for implementing the security check 'owasp-latest-regularly-review-and-update-security-policies'.
      IAM policies define permissions and access controls for AWS resources, making
      them a crucial component of an organization's overall security posture. Regular
      review and updates of these policies are essential to ensure that access privileges
      align with the principle of least privilege and reflect changes in organizational
      requirements, personnel, and security best practices.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource contains information about IAM policies, their creation
      and update dates, and the policy document details, including the actions, resources,
      and effects defined in the policy statements. These fields are crucial for reviewing
      and updating security policies to ensure they align with the organization's
      security requirements and best practices.
