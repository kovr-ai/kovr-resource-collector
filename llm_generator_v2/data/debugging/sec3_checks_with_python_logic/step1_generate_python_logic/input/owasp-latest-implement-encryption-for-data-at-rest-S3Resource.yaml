  literature: Data at rest refers to inactive data stored on any digital medium, such
    as hard drives, databases, cloud storage, or backup tapes. Implementing encryption
    for data at rest is a crucial security measure to protect sensitive information
    from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats. Unencrypted data at
    rest is vulnerable to theft, misuse, or exposure, which can lead to severe consequences
    like identity theft, financial loss, and regulatory non-compliance. Encrypting
    data at rest ensures that even if an attacker gains physical access to the storage
    medium, the data remains unintelligible and unusable without the proper decryption
    keys. This check validates that encryption is implemented for all data at rest,
    following industry-standard encryption algorithms and key management practices.

    literature: The AWS S3 resource is applicable for implementing encryption for
      data at rest. S3 buckets can be configured to use server-side encryption to
      protect data stored in the bucket. AWS provides several encryption options,
      including AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3), AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) managed
      keys, and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Enabling encryption for S3 buckets
      ensures that data is encrypted before it is written to disks, and decrypted
      after it is accessed, providing protection for data at rest.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: The S3 resource provides fields to configure and manage encryption for
      data stored in S3 buckets, which aligns with the security check's requirement
      of implementing encryption for data at rest.
