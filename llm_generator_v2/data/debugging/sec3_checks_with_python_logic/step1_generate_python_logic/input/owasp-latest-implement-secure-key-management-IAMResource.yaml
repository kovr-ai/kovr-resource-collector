  literature: Secure key management is a critical aspect of ensuring the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Keys are used to encrypt and decrypt
    data, authenticate users and systems, and ensure the integrity of data transmissions.
    Improper key management can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other
    security incidents. This check validates that an application or system implements
    secure key management practices, such as using strong encryption algorithms, properly
    generating and storing keys, regularly rotating keys, and securely distributing
    keys to authorized parties. Failure to implement secure key management can result
    in data exposure, unauthorized access, and other security risks.

    literature: The IAM resource in AWS is relevant for implementing secure key management
      practices. IAM allows you to create and manage access keys, which are used to
      securely authenticate requests to AWS services. Proper management of these access
      keys is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality and preventing unauthorized
      access. This resource provides the necessary controls to enforce secure key
      management practices, such as key rotation, key revocation, and access restrictions.
    name: IAMResource
    reason: The IAM resource provides access keys for authenticating requests to AWS
      services, and policies for controlling access permissions. These elements are
      essential for implementing secure key management practices, such as key rotation,
      revocation, and access restrictions.
