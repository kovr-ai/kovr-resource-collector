  literature: The 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations' check is designed
    to ensure that organizations comply with relevant data protection regulations
    and industry standards when handling sensitive information. Data protection regulations,
    such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer
    Privacy Act (CCPA), impose strict requirements on how organizations collect, process,
    store, and transfer personal data. Failure to comply with these regulations can
    result in significant fines and reputational damage. This check helps organizations
    identify potential areas of non-compliance and take appropriate measures to protect
    sensitive data and maintain regulatory compliance.

    literature: The CloudTrailResource in AWS is relevant for implementing the 'owasp-latest-follow-data-protection-regulations'
      security check. CloudTrail is a service that records AWS API calls and related
      events, which can be used to monitor and audit access to sensitive data and
      resources. By configuring CloudTrail trails with appropriate event selectors
      and data resource types, organizations can capture and analyze events related
      to data access, modification, and transfer, helping them identify potential
      violations of data protection regulations and industry standards.
    name: CloudTrailResource
    reason: The CloudTrailResource in AWS provides the necessary configuration options
      to capture and log events related to data access, modification, and transfer,
      which is essential for monitoring and auditing compliance with data protection
      regulations. By configuring appropriate event selectors, data resource types,
      and logging settings, organizations can ensure that relevant events are captured
      and analyzed for potential violations.
