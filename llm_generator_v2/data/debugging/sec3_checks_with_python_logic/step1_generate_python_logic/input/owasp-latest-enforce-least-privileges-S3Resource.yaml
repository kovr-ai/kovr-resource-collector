  literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check validates that applications
    and systems follow the principle of least privilege, which is a fundamental security
    concept that restricts access rights for users, accounts, and processes to only
    those permissions that are essential for performing their intended functions.
    Granting excessive privileges increases the potential attack surface and risk
    of unauthorized access or misuse. This check helps mitigate threats like privilege
    escalation, unauthorized data access, and malicious code execution by ensuring
    that entities operate with the minimum necessary permissions.

    literature: The 'owasp-latest-enforce-least-privileges' check is applicable to
      AWS S3 buckets as they support granular access control mechanisms. S3 bucket
      policies, access control lists (ACLs), and AWS Identity and Access Management
      (IAM) policies can be used to enforce the principle of least privilege by granting
      only the necessary permissions to users, roles, and applications. This helps
      prevent unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential misuse of S3 resources.
    name: S3Resource
    reason: AWS S3 buckets support configurable access controls and policies that
      can enforce the principle of least privilege. The provided field paths allow
      for checking the public access settings, which is a crucial aspect of implementing
      least privilege for S3 buckets.
