  literature: Proper access control mechanisms are essential for ensuring that only
    authorized users or entities can access and perform operations on sensitive data,
    resources, or functionalities within an application or system. Implementing robust
    access control measures helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and
    potential misuse or abuse of privileged operations. This check validates that
    the application or system has implemented appropriate access control mechanisms,
    such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC),
    or other industry-standard access control models. Failure to implement proper
    access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, and potential
    security breaches.

    literature: The Google UserResource contains information related to user accounts
      and their access privileges within the Google Workspace environment. Proper
      access control mechanisms can be implemented by leveraging the admin_info fields
      to define administrative roles and permissions, as well as the security_info
      fields to enforce multi-factor authentication requirements. Additionally, the
      organizational_info.orgUnitPath field can be used to structure organizational
      units and apply access control policies based on the hierarchical structure.
    name: UserResource
    reason: The UserResource provides fields and attributes that can be used to implement
      role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce multi-factor authentication requirements,
      which are essential components of proper access control mechanisms.
