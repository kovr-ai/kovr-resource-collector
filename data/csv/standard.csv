IL4 requires a comprehensive set of security controls, including: 
Access controls
Identification and authentication
Encryption
Auditing
Monitoring
More rigorous physical and environmental security measures
More extensive personnel security measures

What it covers
IL5 covers unclassified but highly sensitive information, including: 
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) 
Mission-critical information 
Unclassified National Security Information (U-NSI)

Why it's important
IL5 is important because the loss of this data could result in: 
Loss of life 
Catastrophic damage to national security 
Grave damage to the DoD's ability to conduct operations 
Security controls
IL5 requires extremely stringent security controls, including: 
Continuous monitoring 
Advanced access controls 
Data encryption 
Other security protocols 
Who's responsible
The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is responsible for developing and maintaining the DoD SRG. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) that support DoD customers must comply with the SRG's requirements.",,,2024-12-23T18:25:25.130787,2024-12-23T18:25:25.130787,True,2,6

It ensures stringent security controls, high levels of data protection, and adherence to U.S. government and DoD policies.","The Department of Defense (DoD) Security Requirements Guide (SRG) for Impact Level 5 (IL5) pertains to the handling and protection of controlled unclassified information (CUI) and National Security Systems (NSS) within cloud environments. IL5 represents a heightened level of security that requires compliance with numerous DoD-specific security measures, including strict identity management, data segregation, encryption, and auditing protocols.

This level is particularly designed for scenarios where CUI or mission-critical data is processed, stored, or transmitted, ensuring compliance with DoD directives and safeguarding against potential cyber threats. Providers operating at IL5 must demonstrate capabilities such as geographic separation of data, robust disaster recovery, and the use of U.S. personnel for access and management. Adherence to IL5 requirements supports DoD's mission readiness while maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.",,,2024-12-23T18:25:25.130787,2024-12-23T18:25:25.130787,True,2,5

IL6 builds on the requirements of lower impact levels, adding advanced controls to safeguard classified information from unauthorized access, breaches, and cyber threats.

This framework mandates robust security measures, including end-to-end encryption, classified data handling protocols, adherence to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and stringent access controls limited to U.S. citizens with appropriate clearances. IL6 environments also require isolation from lower classification levels and operate within government-approved facilities.
