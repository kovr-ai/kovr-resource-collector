 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2025-01-13T15:16:58.420796,2025-01-13T15:16:58.420796

 RA-5 (e) Requirement: to include all Authorizing Officials; for JAB authorizations to include FedRAMP
 
 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.",2025-01-13T15:16:58.420796,2025-01-13T15:16:58.420796

 For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8(1), physical means as specified in SC-8(5), or in combination.
 
 For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
  - Crossing the system boundary
  - Between compute instances - including containers
  - From a compute instance to storage
  - Replication between availability zones
  - Transmission of backups to storage
  - From a load balancer to a compute instance
  - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.
 
 The following applies only when choosing SC-8(5) in lieu of SC-8(1).
 FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters 
 SC-8(5)-1 [a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)]
 SC-8(5)-2 [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information] 
 
 SC-8 Guidance:
 SC-8(5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.
 
 Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA). 
 
 Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2(1), PE-2(2), PE-2(3), PE-3(2), PE-3(3), PE-6(2), and PE-6(3).
 
 Note: When selecting SC-8(5), the above SC-8(5), and the above referenced PE controls must be added to the SSP.

 A. Organizations may apply full disk encryption (FDE) to a mobile device where the primary threat is loss of the device while storage is locked. 
 B. For a database application housing data for a single customer, encryption at the file system level would often provide more protection than FDE against the more likely threat of an intruder on the operating system accessing the storage.
 C. For a database application housing data for multiple customers, encryption with unique keys for each customer at the database record level may be more appropriate.",2025-01-13T15:16:58.420796,2025-01-13T15:16:58.420796

 CM-6 (a) Requirement 2: The service provider shall ensure that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) validated or SCAP compatible (if validated checklists are not available).
 
 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2025-01-13T15:18:12.186151,2025-01-13T15:18:12.186151

 RA-5 (e) Requirement: to include all Authorizing Officials; for JAB authorizations to include FedRAMP
 
 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.",2025-01-13T15:18:12.186151,2025-01-13T15:18:12.186151

 For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
  - Crossing the system boundary
  - Between compute instances - including containers
  - From a compute instance to storage
  - Replication between availability zones
  - Transmission of backups to storage
  - From a load balancer to a compute instance
  - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.

 CM-6 (a) Requirement 2: The service provider shall ensure that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) validated or SCAP compatible (if validated checklists are not available).
 
 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2024-12-23T15:34:01.702601,2024-12-23T15:34:01.702601

 RA-5 (e) Requirement: to include all Authorizing Officials; for JAB authorizations to include FedRAMP
 
 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.",2024-12-23T15:34:01.702601,2024-12-23T15:34:01.702601

 For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8(1), physical means as specified in SC-8(5), or in combination.
 
 For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
  - Crossing the system boundary
  - Between compute instances - including containers
  - From a compute instance to storage
  - Replication between availability zones
  - Transmission of backups to storage
  - From a load balancer to a compute instance
  - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.
 
 The following applies only when choosing SC-8(5) in lieu of SC-8(1).
 FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters 
 SC-8(5)-1 [a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)]
 SC-8(5)-2 [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information] 
 
 SC-8 Guidance:
 SC-8(5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.
 
 Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA). 
 
 Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2(1), PE-2(2), PE-2(3), PE-3(2), PE-3(3), PE-6(2), and PE-6(3).
 
 Note: When selecting SC-8(5), the above SC-8(5), and the above referenced PE controls must be added to the SSP.

 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2024-12-23T15:34:55.247468,2024-12-23T15:34:55.247468

 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.",2024-12-23T15:34:55.247468,2024-12-23T15:34:55.247468

 For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8(1), physical means as specified in SC-8(5), or in combination.
 
 For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
  - Crossing the system boundary
  - Between compute instances - including containers
  - From a compute instance to storage
  - Replication between availability zones
  - Transmission of backups to storage
  - From a load balancer to a compute instance
  - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.
 
 The following applies only when choosing SC-8(5) in lieu of SC-8(1).

 SC-8 Guidance:
 SC-8(5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.
 
 Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA). 
 
 Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2(1), PE-2(2), PE-2(3), PE-3(2), PE-3(3), PE-6(2), and PE-6(3).

  - Encryption of data
  - Decryption of data
  - Generation of one time passwords (OTPs) for MFA
  - Protocols such as TLS, SSH, and HTTPS
 
 The requirement for FIPS 140 validation, as well as timelines for acceptance of FIPS 140-2, and 140-3 can be found at the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).
 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program

 CM-6 (a) Requirement 2: The service provider shall ensure that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) validated or SCAP compatible (if validated checklists are not available).
 
 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2024-12-23T15:35:38.346775,2024-12-23T15:35:38.346775

 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.",2024-12-23T15:35:38.346775,2024-12-23T15:35:38.346775

 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2024-12-23T15:37:21.821548,2024-12-23T15:37:21.821548

 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.",2024-12-23T15:37:21.821548,2024-12-23T15:37:21.821548

  - Crossing the system boundary
  - Between compute instances - including containers
  - From a compute instance to storage
  - Replication between availability zones
  - Transmission of backups to storage
  - From a load balancer to a compute instance
  - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.

 Examples:
 A. Organizations may apply full disk encryption (FDE) to a mobile device where the primary threat is loss of the device while storage is locked. 
 B. For a database application housing data for a single customer, encryption at the file system level would often provide more protection than FDE against the more likely threat of an intruder on the operating system accessing the storage.
 C. For a database application housing data for multiple customers, encryption with unique keys for each customer at the database record level may be more appropriate.",2024-12-23T15:37:21.821548,2024-12-23T15:37:21.821548

 CM-6 (a) Requirement 2: The service provider shall ensure that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) validated or SCAP compatible (if validated checklists are not available).
 
 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2024-12-23T15:38:07.797271,2024-12-23T15:38:07.797271

 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies.

 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item.

 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.",2024-12-23T15:38:57.577736,2024-12-23T15:38:57.577736

 For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8(1), physical means as specified in SC-8(5), or in combination.
 
 For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
  - Crossing the system boundary
  - Between compute instances - including containers
  - From a compute instance to storage
  - Replication between availability zones
  - Transmission of backups to storage
  - From a load balancer to a compute instance
  - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.
 
 The following applies only when choosing SC-8(5) in lieu of SC-8(1).

 RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
 Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
 Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies.

 CM-6 (a) Requirement 2: The service provider shall ensure that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) validated or SCAP compatible (if validated checklists are not available).
 
 CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
 During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2025-03-20T12:20:34.711523,2025-03-20T12:20:34.711523

3634,12,931,SC-8 [confidentiality AND integrity],"SC-8 Guidance:
 For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8(1), physical means as specified in SC-8(5), or in combination.
 
 For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
  - Crossing the system boundary
  - Between compute instances - including containers
  - From a compute instance to storage
  - Replication between availability zones
  - Transmission of backups to storage
  - From a load balancer to a compute instance
  - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.
 
 The following applies only when choosing SC-8(5) in lieu of SC-8(1).
 FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters 
 SC-8(5)-1 [a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)]
 SC-8(5)-2 [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information] 
 
 SC-8 Guidance:
 SC-8(5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.
 
 Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA). 
 
 Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2(1), PE-2(2), PE-2(3), PE-3(2), PE-3(3), PE-6(2), and PE-6(3).
 
 Note: When selecting SC-8(5), the above SC-8(5), and the above referenced PE controls must be added to the SSP.

3635,12,948,SC-13 (b) [FIPS-validated or NSA-approved cryptography],"SC-13 Guidance:
 This control applies to all use of cryptography. In addition to encryption, this includes functions such as hashing, random number generation, and key generation. Examples include the following:
  - Encryption of data
  - Decryption of data
  - Generation of one time passwords (OTPs) for MFA
  - Protocols such as TLS, SSH, and HTTPS
 
 The requirement for FIPS 140 validation, as well as timelines for acceptance of FIPS 140-2, and 140-3 can be found at the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).
 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program 
 
 SC-13 Guidance: For NSA-approved cryptography, the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) oversees a national program to evaluate Commercial IT Products for Use in National Security Systems. The NIAP Product Compliant List can be found at the following location:
 https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Product/index.cfm 
 
 SC-13 Guidance: When leveraging encryption from underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some IaaS/PaaS provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify encryption is properly configured. 
 
 SC-13 Guidance:
 Moving to non-FIPS CM or product is acceptable when:
 - FIPS validated version has a known vulnerability
 - Feature with vulnerability is in use
 - Non-FIPS version fixes the vulnerability
 - Non-FIPS version is submitted to NIST for FIPS validation
 - POA&M is added to track approval, and deployment when ready
 
 SC-13 Guidance: At a minimum, this control applies to cryptography in use for the following controls: AU-9(3), CP-9(8), IA-2(6), IA-5(1), MP-5, SC-8(1), and SC-28(1).",2025-03-20T12:20:34.711523,2025-03-20T12:20:34.711523

CM-6 Guidance: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities. SPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, StateRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the SP’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from SP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. SPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",2025-07-09T23:49:36.587897,2025-07-09T23:49:36.587897

RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for StateRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the StateRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a SP, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies.

For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8 (1),  physical means as specified in SC-8 (5), or in combination.

For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
 - Crossing the system boundary
 - Between compute instances - including containers
 - From a compute instance to storage
 - Replication between availability zones
 - Transmission of backups to storage
 - From a load balancer to a compute instance
 - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.

The following applies only when choosing SC-8 (5) in lieu of SC-8 (1).
StateRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters 
SC-8 (5)-1 [a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)]
SC-8 (5)-2 [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information] 

SC-8 Guidance:
SC-8 (5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.

Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA). 

Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. SPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2 (1), PE-2 (2), PE-2 (3), PE-3 (2), PE-3 (3), PE-6 (2), and PE-6 (3).

4838,14,931,SC-8 [confidentiality AND integrity],"SC-8 Guidance:
For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8 (1),  physical means as specified in SC-8 (5), or in combination.

For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
 - Crossing the system boundary
 - Between compute instances - including containers
 - From a compute instance to storage
 - Replication between availability zones
 - Transmission of backups to storage
 - From a load balancer to a compute instance
 - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.",2025-07-09T23:52:19.279039,2025-07-09T23:52:19.279039

SC-8 (1) Guidance:

SC-8 (1) applies when encryption has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. Otherwise refer to SC-8 (5). SC-8 (1) is strongly encouraged.

SC-8 (1) Guidance: Note that this enhancement requires the use of cryptography which must be compliant with State requirements and utilize FIPS compliant algorithms
